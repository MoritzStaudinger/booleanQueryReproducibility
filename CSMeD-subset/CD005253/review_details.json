    "title": "Iodine supplementation for the prevention of mortality and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants",
    "abstract": "Background Parenteral nutrition solutions, artificial formulas, and human breast milk contain insufficient iodine to meet recommended intakes for preterm infants. Iodine deficiency may exacerbate transient hypothyroxinaemia in preterm infants and this may be associated with adverse neonatal and longer\u2010term outcomes.    Objectives To assess the evidence from randomised controlled trials that dietary supplementation with iodine reduces mortality and morbidity in preterm infants.    Search methods We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid Maternity & Infant Care Database, and CINAHL to February 2018. We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi\u2010randomised trials.    Selection criteria Randomised or quasi\u2010randomised controlled trials that compared supplementing enteral or parenteral feeds with iodine (as iodide salt) versus placebo or no supplementation in preterm infants.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. We analysed treatment effects as described in the individual trials and reported risk ratios (RR) and risk differences for dichotomous data, and mean differences (MD) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used a fixed\u2010effect model in meta\u2010analyses and planned to explore potential causes of heterogeneity in sensitivity analyses. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.    Main results Two randomised controlled trials fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Both trials used methods to limit bias including allocation concealment and blinding of clinicians and investigators to the allocated intervention. The trials enrolled 1394 infants. One trial recruited 1273 participants. Most participants were born very preterm (less than 32 weeks' gestation) and about one\u2010third were extremely preterm (less than 28 weeks' gestation). Analyses found no effect of iodine supplementation on mortality before hospital discharge (typical RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.42; typical RD 0.00, 95% CI \u20100.03 to 0.03; 2 studies, 1380 infants) or on neurodevelopmental assessments at two years post\u2010term (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition main domain composite scores: cognitive: MD \u20130.30, 95% CI \u20132.44 to 1.84; motor: MD 0.20, 95% CI \u20132.15 to 2.55; language: MD \u20130.10, 95% CI \u20132.50 to 2.30; 1 study, 1259 infants). There were no differences in the proportion of infants who died or had a composite score less than 85 in any main Bayley domain (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.17; RD 0.02 95% CI \u20100.03 to 0.08; 1 study, 1259 infants), or had visual impairment (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.45; RD \u20100.01 95% CI \u20100.03 to 0.01; 1 study, 1092 infants) or auditory impairment (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.16; RD 0.00 95% CI \u20100.02 to 0.02 1 study, 1093 infants). Using GRADE methods, we assessed the evidence for the effects on mortality and neurodevelopment outcomes as high\u2010certainty.    Authors' conclusions The available trial data, predominantly from one large, high\u2010quality multicentre study published in 2017, do not show any evidence of beneficial effects of iodine supplementation for preterm infants. Given the high certainty of these estimates of effect, further trials of this intervention in this population are unlikely to be considered research priorities.",

        "Appendix 2. Risk of bias tool": "1. Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?   For each included study, we categorised the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:     low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);    high risk (any non\u2010random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or    unclear risk.    2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?   For each included study, we categorised the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:     low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);    high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non\u2010opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); or    unclear risk.    3. Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?   For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or class of outcomes. We categorised the methods as:     low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for participants; and   low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for personnel.    4. Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented at the time of outcome assessment?   For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind outcome assessment. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or class of outcomes. We categorised the methods as:     low risk for outcome assessors;   high risk for outcome assessors; or   unclear risk for outcome assessors.    5. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?   For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we reincluded missing data in the analyses. We categorised the methods as:     low risk (less than 20% missing data);   high risk (20% or greater missing data); or   unclear risk.    6. Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?   For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. For studies in which study protocols were published in advance, we compared prespecified outcomes versus outcomes eventually reported in the published results. If the study protocol was not published in advance, we contacted study authors to gain access to the study protocol. We assessed the methods as:     low risk (where it is clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);    high risk (where not all the study's prespecified outcomes were reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified outcomes of interest and were reported incompletely and so could not be used; study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or    unclear risk.    7. Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?   For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data\u2010dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:     low risk;   high risk; or   unclear risk.    If needed, we explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.",
        "Appendix 3. GRADE": "GRADE considers that evidence from randomised controlled trials is 'high' quality but that assessment may be downgraded based on consideration of any of five areas:     design (risk of bias);   consistency across studies;   directness of the evidence;   precision of estimates; and   presence of publication bias.    GRADE Working Group grades of evidence High certainty: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect."
