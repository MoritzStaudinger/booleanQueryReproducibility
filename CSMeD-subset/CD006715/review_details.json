    "title": "Epidural analgesia for adults undergoing cardiac surgery with or without cardiopulmonary bypass",
    "abstract": "Background General anaesthesia combined with epidural analgesia may have a beneficial effect on clinical outcomes. However, use of epidural analgesia for cardiac surgery is controversial due to a theoretical increased risk of epidural haematoma associated with systemic heparinization. This review was published in 2013, and it was updated in 2019.    Objectives To determine the impact of perioperative epidural analgesia in adults undergoing cardiac surgery, with or without cardiopulmonary bypass, on perioperative mortality and cardiac, pulmonary, or neurological morbidity.    Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in November 2018, and two trial registers up to February 2019, together with references and relevant conference abstracts.    Selection criteria We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including adults undergoing any type of cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia and comparing epidural analgesia versus another modality of postoperative pain treatment. The primary outcome was mortality.    Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.   Main results We included 69 trials with 4860 participants: 2404 given epidural analgesia and 2456 receiving comparators (systemic analgesia, peripheral nerve block, intrapleural analgesia, or wound infiltration). The mean (or median) age of participants varied between 43.5 years and 74.6 years. Surgeries performed were coronary artery bypass grafting or valvular procedures and surgeries for congenital heart disease. We judged that no trials were at low risk of bias for all domains, and that all trials were at unclear/high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel taking care of study participants.  Epidural analgesia versus systemic analgesia   Trials show there may be no difference in mortality at 0 to 30 days (risk difference (RD) 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22120.01 to 0.01; 38 trials with 3418 participants; low\u2010quality evidence), and there may be a reduction in myocardial infarction at 0 to 30 days (RD \u22120.01, 95% CI \u22120.02 to 0.00; 26 trials with 2713 participants; low\u2010quality evidence). Epidural analgesia may reduce the risk of 0 to 30 days respiratory depression (RD \u22120.03, 95% CI \u22120.05 to \u22120.01; 21 trials with 1736 participants; low\u2010quality evidence). There is probably little or no difference in risk of pneumonia at 0 to 30 days (RD \u22120.03, 95% CI \u22120.07 to 0.01; 10 trials with 1107 participants; moderate\u2010quality evidence), and epidural analgesia probably reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter at 0 to 2 weeks (RD \u22120.06, 95% CI \u22120.10 to \u22120.01; 18 trials with 2431 participants; moderate\u2010quality evidence). There may be no difference in cerebrovascular accidents at 0 to 30 days (RD \u22120.00, 95% CI \u22120.01 to 0.01; 18 trials with 2232 participants; very low\u2010quality evidence), and none of the included trials reported any epidural haematoma events at 0 to 30 days (53 trials with 3982 participants; low\u2010quality evidence). Epidural analgesia probably reduces the duration of tracheal intubation by the equivalent of 2.4 hours (standardized mean difference (SMD) \u22120.78, 95% CI \u22121.01 to \u22120.55; 40 trials with 3353 participants; moderate\u2010quality evidence). Epidural analgesia reduces pain at rest and on movement up to 72 hours after surgery. At six to eight hours, researchers noted a reduction in pain, equivalent to a reduction of 1 point on a 0 to 10 pain scale (SMD \u22121.35, 95% CI \u22121.98 to \u22120.72; 10 trials with 502 participants; moderate\u2010quality evidence). Epidural analgesia may increase risk of hypotension (RD 0.21, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.33; 17 trials with 870 participants; low\u2010quality evidence) but may make little or no difference in the need for infusion of inotropics or vasopressors (RD 0.00, 95% CI \u22120.06 to 0.07; 23 trials with 1821 participants; low\u2010quality evidence).  Epidural analgesia versus other comparators   Fewer studies compared epidural analgesia versus peripheral nerve blocks (four studies), intrapleural analgesia (one study), and wound infiltration (one study). Investigators provided no data for pulmonary complications, atrial fibrillation or flutter, or for any of the comparisons. When reported, other outcomes for these comparisons (mortality, myocardial infarction, neurological complications, duration of tracheal intubation, pain, and haemodynamic support) were uncertain due to the small numbers of trials and participants.    Authors' conclusions Compared with systemic analgesia, epidural analgesia may reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, respiratory depression, and atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, as well as the duration of tracheal intubation and pain, in adults undergoing cardiac surgery. There may be little or no difference in mortality, pneumonia, and epidural haematoma, and effects on cerebrovascular accident are uncertain. Evidence is insufficient to show the effects of epidural analgesia compared with peripheral nerve blocks, intrapleural analgesia, or wound infiltration.",
