    "title": "Prescribed hypocaloric nutrition support for critically\u2010ill adults",
    "abstract": "Background There are controversies about the amount of calories and the type of nutritional support that should be given to critically\u2010ill people. Several authors advocate the potential benefits of hypocaloric nutrition support, but the evidence is inconclusive.    Objectives To assess the effects of prescribed hypocaloric nutrition support in comparison with standard nutrition support for critically\u2010ill adults    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS (from inception to 20 June 2017) with a specific strategy for each database. We also assessed three websites, conference proceedings and reference lists, and contacted leaders in the field and the pharmaceutical industry for undetected/unpublished studies. There was no restriction by date, language or publication status.    Selection criteria We included randomized and quasi\u2010randomized controlled trials comparing hypocaloric nutrition support to normo\u2010 or hypercaloric nutrition support or no nutrition support (e.g. fasting) in adults hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs).    Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We meta\u2010analysed data for comparisons in which clinical heterogeneity was low. We conducted prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses, and post hoc analyses, including meta\u2010regression. Our primary outcomes were: mortality (death occurred during the ICU and hospital stay, or 28\u2010 to 30\u2010day all\u2010cause mortality); length of stay (days stayed in the ICU and in the hospital); and Infectious complications. Secondary outcomes included: length of mechanical ventilation. We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE.    Main results We identified 15 trials, with a total of 3129 ICU participants from university\u2010associated hospitals in the USA, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Greece, Germany and Iran. There are two ongoing studies. Participants suffered from medical and surgical conditions, with a variety of inclusion criteria. Four studies used parenteral nutrition and nine studies used only enteral nutrition; it was unclear whether the remaining two used parenteral nutrition. Most of them could not achieve the proposed caloric targets, resulting in small differences in the administered calories between intervention and control groups. Most studies were funded by the US government or non\u2010governmental associations, but three studies received funding from industry. Five studies did not specify their funding sources.  The included studies suffered from important clinical and statistical heterogeneity. This heterogeneity did not allow us to report pooled estimates of the primary and secondary outcomes, so we have described them narratively.  When comparing hypocaloric nutrition support with a control nutrition support, for hospital mortality (9 studies, 1775 participants), the risk ratios ranged from 0.23 to 5.54; for ICU mortality (4 studies, 1291 participants) the risk ratios ranged from 0.81 to 5.54, and for mortality at 30 days (7 studies, 2611 participants) the risk ratios ranged from 0.79 to 3.00. Most of these estimates included the null value. The quality of the evidence was very low due to unclear or high risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision.  Participants who received hypocaloric nutrition support compared to control nutrition support had a range of mean hospital lengths of stay of 15.70 days lower to 10.70 days higher (10 studies, 1677 participants), a range of mean ICU lengths of stay 11.00 days lower to 5.40 days higher (11 studies, 2942 participants) and a range of mean lengths of mechanical ventilation of 13.20 days lower to 8.36 days higher (12 studies, 3000 participants). The quality of the evidence for this outcome was very low due to unclear or high risk of bias in most studies, inconsistency and imprecision.  The risk ratios for infectious complications (10 studies, 2804 participants) of each individual study ranged from 0.54 to 2.54. The quality of the evidence for this outcome was very low due to unclear or high risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision  We were not able to explain the causes of the observed heterogeneity using subgroup and sensitivity analyses or meta\u2010regression.    Authors' conclusions The included studies had substantial clinical heterogeneity. We found very low\u2010quality evidence about the effects of prescribed hypocaloric nutrition support on mortality in hospital, in the ICU and at 30 days, as well as in length of hospital and ICU stay, infectious complications and the length of mechanical ventilation. For these outcomes there is uncertainty about the effects of prescribed hypocaloric nutrition, since the range of estimates includes both appreciable benefits and harms.  Given these limitations, results must be interpreted with caution in the clinical field, considering the unclear balance of the risks and harms of this intervention. Future research addressing the clinical heterogeneity of participants and interventions, study limitations and sample size could clarify the effects of this intervention.",

        "Types of interventions": "The experimental intervention evaluated was: hypocaloric nutrition support with fewer total calories than measured resting energy expenditure (REE) by indirect calorimetry or, if not measured, less than 25 kcal/kg/day. This could be done through restricted doses of carbohydrates or lipids, or both, with either normal or increased protein dose. The control intervention was: Normo\u2010 or hypercaloric nutrition support: equal to or more than the measured REE or than 25 kcal/kg/day (with the same characteristics as above); or    No nutrition support at all: fasting or dextrose solutions. Normo\u2010 or hypercaloric nutrition support: equal to or more than the measured REE or than 25 kcal/kg/day (with the same characteristics as above); or No nutrition support at all: fasting or dextrose solutions. We evaluated the results of trials designed to compare prescribed hypocaloric enteral or parenteral nutrition support (or permissive underfeeding) with standard nutrition support, or with no nutrition, even if those trials did not reach their caloric goals in the intervention or control groups (intention\u2010to\u2010treat analysis). Furthermore, we did not include trials that planned to provide full nutrition support but resulted in unintended hypocaloric provision (for any reason).",

Meta\u2010regression": "STATA 14.1 outputs exploring the effect of several explanatory variables on the primary outcomes with the highest number of included studies: mortality in hospital, infectious complications, length of hospital stay and length of ICU stay. The covariates included in the models were: type of participants [typepatient]; calories received by the intervention group in three categories categorized [catcal]; difference in the amount of calories received by the control groups minus the intervention group [difcal].  The explanatory variables were defined as follow:    typepatient: surgical participant vs medical participant (all surgical participants received parenteral nutrition and medical received enteral nutrition) (See Table 1).    catcal: categories denominated by the amount of calories really received by the intervention groups, according to the following: very hypocaloric \u2264 10 kcal/kg/day (icatcal 2); hypocaloric \u2265 10 to < 25 kcal/kg/day (icatcal 1); normocalcaloric or hypercaloric \u2265 25 kcal/kg/day (icatcal 0) (see Table 2).    difcal: absolute difference in kcal/kg/day received by the control minus the intervention groups (see Table 3).     We analysed several different models for each outcome. We only presented the model with the three covariates of each outcome, including the full output of the STATA 14.1 statistics.  In each model the covariates were typed in bold (see above definitions). The other codes in tables were:     logrr: Relative risk of dichotomic outcomes.    ES: Mean difference of continuous outcomes.    Coef.: Value of the relative risk or the mean difference in their units    P > t: Probability that the Logrr difference adjusted by other covariates could be related to chance if P is higher than 0.05    Std. Err: Standard error of the coefficient.    t: test.    P > t: Probability that the Logrr difference adjusted by other covariates could be related to chance if P is higher than 0.05 (not significant).    95% conf. interval: 95% confidence interval of the Logrr or ES values.     It is important to state the limitations of this meta\u2010regression because of the limited number of studies for the number of covariates in the model.
