    "title": "Imaging modalities for the non\u2010invasive diagnosis of endometriosis",
    "abstract": "Background About 10% of women of reproductive age suffer from endometriosis. Endometriosis is a costly chronic disease that causes pelvic pain and subfertility. Laparoscopy, the gold standard diagnostic test for endometriosis, is expensive and carries surgical risks. Currently, no non\u2010invasive tests that can be used to accurately diagnose endometriosis are available in clinical practice. This is the first review of diagnostic test accuracy of imaging tests for endometriosis that uses Cochrane methods to provide an update on the rapidly expanding literature in this field.    Objectives \u2022 To provide estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis, ovarian endometriosis and deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) versus surgical diagnosis as a reference standard.  \u2022 To describe performance of imaging tests for mapping of deep endometriotic lesions in the pelvis at specific anatomical sites.  Imaging tests were evaluated as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery and as triage tests that would assist decision making regarding diagnostic surgery for endometriosis.    Search methods We searched the following databases to 20 April 2015: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, LILACS, OAIster, TRIP, ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDION, DARE, and PubMed. Searches were not restricted to a particular study design or language nor to specific publication dates. The search strategy incorporated words in the title, abstracts, text words across the record and medical subject headings (MeSH).    Selection criteria We considered published peer\u2010reviewed cross\u2010sectional studies and randomised controlled trials of any size that included prospectively recruited women of reproductive age suspected of having one or more of the following target conditions: endometrioma, pelvic endometriosis, DIE or endometriotic lesions at specific intrapelvic anatomical locations. We included studies that compared the diagnostic test accuracy of one or more imaging modalities versus findings of surgical visualisation of endometriotic lesions.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently collected and performed a quality assessment of data from each study. For each imaging test, data were classified as positive or negative for surgical detection of endometriosis, and sensitivity and specificity estimates were calculated. If two or more tests were evaluated in the same cohort, each was considered as a separate data set. We used the bivariate model to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity when sufficient data sets were available. Predetermined criteria for a clinically useful imaging test to replace diagnostic surgery included sensitivity \u2265 94% and specificity \u2265 79%. Criteria for triage tests were set at sensitivity \u2265 95% and specificity \u2265 50%, ruling out the diagnosis with a negative result (SnNout test \u2010 if sensitivity is high, a negative test rules out pathology) or at sensitivity \u2265 50% with specificity \u2265 95%, ruling in the diagnosis with a positive result (SpPin test \u2010 if specificity is high, a positive test rules in pathology).    Main results We included 49 studies involving 4807 women: 13 studies evaluated pelvic endometriosis, 10 endometriomas and 15 DIE, and 33 studies addressed endometriosis at specific anatomical sites. Most studies were of poor methodological quality. The most studied modalities were transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with outcome measures commonly demonstrating diversity in diagnostic estimates; however, sources of heterogeneity could not be reliably determined. No imaging test met the criteria for a replacement or triage test for detecting pelvic endometriosis, albeit TVUS approached the criteria for a SpPin triage test. For endometrioma, TVUS (eight studies, 765 participants; sensitivity 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87, 0.99), specificity 0.96 (95% CI 0.92, 0.99)) qualified as a SpPin triage test and approached the criteria for a replacement and SnNout triage test, whereas MRI (three studies, 179 participants; sensitivity 0.95 (95% CI 0.90, 1.00), specificity 0.91 (95% CI 0.86, 0.97)) met the criteria for a replacement and SnNout triage test and approached the criteria for a SpPin test. For DIE, TVUS (nine studies, 12 data sets, 934 participants; sensitivity 0.79 (95% CI 0.69, 0.89) and specificity 0.94 (95% CI 0.88, 1.00)) approached the criteria for a SpPin triage test, and MRI (six studies, seven data sets, 266 participants; sensitivity 0.94 (95% CI 0.90, 0.97), specificity 0.77 (95% CI 0.44, 1.00)) approached the criteria for a replacement and SnNout triage test. Other imaging tests assessed in small individual studies could not be statistically evaluated.  TVUS met the criteria for a SpPin triage test in mapping DIE to uterosacral ligaments, rectovaginal septum, vaginal wall, pouch of Douglas (POD) and rectosigmoid. MRI met the criteria for a SpPin triage test for POD and vaginal and rectosigmoid endometriosis. Transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) might qualify as a SpPin triage test for rectosigmoid involvement but could not be adequately assessed for other anatomical sites because heterogeneous data were scant. Multi\u2010detector computerised tomography enema (MDCT\u2010e) displayed the highest diagnostic performance for rectosigmoid and other bowel endometriosis and met the criteria for both SpPin and SnNout triage tests, but studies were too few to provide meaningful results.  Diagnostic accuracies were higher for TVUS with bowel preparation (TVUS\u2010BP) and rectal water contrast (RWC\u2010TVS) and for 3.0TMRI than for conventional methods, although the paucity of studies precluded statistical evaluation.    Authors' conclusions None of the evaluated imaging modalities were able to detect overall pelvic endometriosis with enough accuracy that they would be suggested to replace surgery. Specifically for endometrioma, TVUS qualified as a SpPin triage test. MRI displayed sufficient accuracy to suggest utility as a replacement test, but the data were too scant to permit meaningful conclusions. TVUS could be used clinically to identify additional anatomical sites of DIE compared with MRI, thus facilitating preoperative planning. Rectosigmoid endometriosis was the only site that could be accurately mapped by using TVUS, TRUS, MRI or MDCT\u2010e. Studies evaluating recent advances in imaging modalities such as TVUS\u2010BP, RWC\u2010TVS, 3.0TMRI and MDCT\u2010e were observed to have high diagnostic accuracies but were too few to allow prudent evaluation of their diagnostic role. In view of the low quality of most of the included studies, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. Future well\u2010designed diagnostic studies undertaken to compare imaging tests for diagnostic test accuracy and costs are recommended.",

        "Types of studies": "Published peer\u2010reviewed studies that compared results of one or several types of imaging tests versus results obtained from a surgical diagnosis of endometriosis. We included studies if they were: randomised controlled trials;   observational studies of prospectively recruited women of the following designs:   \u2018single gate design\u2019 (studies with a single set of inclusion criteria defined by clinical presentation). All participants had clinically suspected endometriosis; or    \u2018two\u2010gate design\u2019 (studies in which participants are sampled from distinct populations with respect to clinical presentation). The same study includes participants with a clinical suspicion of having the target condition (e.g. women with pelvic pain) and participants in whom the target condition is not suspected (e.g. women admitted for tubal ligation). Two\u2010gate studies were eligible only when all cases and controls belonged to the same population with respect to the reference standard (i.e. all participants were scheduled for laparoscopy) (Rutjes 2005).      performed in any healthcare setting; or   published in any language; randomised controlled trials; observational studies of prospectively recruited women of the following designs: \u2018single gate design\u2019 (studies with a single set of inclusion criteria defined by clinical presentation).

We excluded the following studies. Studies of specific study designs.   Narrative or systematic review.   Study of retrospective design when the index test was performed after execution of a reference test, or participants were selected through a retrospective review of case notes. Knowledge of the reference test could bias relatively subjective index tests. If endometriosis is found at a diagnostic surgical procedure, excision is commonly carried out concurrently, and this could bias the results of an index test performed after the reference standard.    Case report or case series.     Studies reported only in abstract form or in conference proceedings for which the full text was not available. This limitation was applied when we faced substantial difficulty in obtaining the information from abstracts, which precluded a reliable assessment of eligibility and methodological quality.

        "Participants": "Study participants included women of reproductive age (puberty to menopause) with suspected endometriosis based on clinical symptoms and/or pelvic examination, who undertook both the index test and the reference standard. Participants were selected from populations of women undergoing abdominal surgery for the following indications: (1) clinically suspected endometriosis (pelvic pain, infertility, abnormal pelvic examination or a combination of these), (2) ovarian mass regardless of symptoms, (3) a mixed group, which consists of women with suspected endometriosis/ovarian mass and/or women with other benign gynaecological conditions (e.g. surgical sterilisation, fibroid uterus). Articles that included participants of postmenopausal age were eligible when data for the reproductive age group were available in isolation. Studies were excluded when the study population involved participants who clearly would not undergo the index test in a clinical scenario and/or would not benefit from the test (e.g. women with ectopic pregnancies, gynaecological malignancies, acute pelvic inflammatory disease). We also excluded publications in which only a subset of participants with a positive index test or reference standard were included in the analysis, and data for the whole cohort were not available.",
        "Index tests": "All types of imaging modalities for endometriosis, including possible modifications to conventional techniques, were assessed separately or in combination with other imaging tests. We attempted to group several types of tests that were based on common technical principles and similarity in clinical applicability. The index tests assessed are presented and described in Table 2. We considered studies only if data were reported in sufficient detail for construction of 2 \u00d7 2 contingency tables. We included only studies that reported diagnostic accuracy estimates per number of participants ('participant\u2010level' analysis). We undertook an independent evaluation of the diagnostic test accuracy of imaging tests to anatomically map endometriotic lesions because multiple endometriotic implants can co\u2010exist at different sites in the same individual. For this 'region level' analysis, only analyses that recorded data estimates per number of participants were included, as information about the accuracy of imaging tests for mapping the disease is more informative and clinically applicable when presented as per\u2010participant calculations of accuracy estimates. Combined evaluations of imaging tests and other methods of diagnosing endometriosis (e.g. pelvic examination; urine, endometrial or blood tests) are beyond the scope of this review and are presented separately in another review titled 'Combined tests for the non\u2010invasive diagnosis of endometriosis'. We excluded from the review studies that solely assessed specific technical aspects, radiological criteria or interobserver variability of index tests without reporting data on diagnostic performance. The diagnostic performance of an index test was considered high when the test reached the criteria for a replacement test (sensitivity \u2265 94% with specificity \u2265 79%) or a triage test (sensitivity \u2265 95% with specificity \u2265 50%, or vice versa). We categorised as 'approaching' high accuracy imaging tests with diagnostic estimates within 5% of set thresholds. We considered all other diagnostic estimates as low.",
        "Target conditions": "Investigators assessed three target conditions. Pelvic endometriosis: defined as endometrial tissue located within the pelvic cavity, including any of the pelvic organs, peritoneum and pouch of Douglas.    Ovarian endometriosis (endometrioma): defined as ovarian cysts lined by endometrial tissue and appearing as an ovarian mass of varying size.    DIE: defined as subperitoneal infiltration of endometrial implants, for example, when endometriotic implants penetrate the retroperitoneal space for a distance of 5 mm or more. Posterior DIE is the most common form of DIE, and both conditions are interchangeably reported. For the purpose of this review, we combined them as a single target condition \u2010 DIE/posterior DIE. Pelvic endometriosis: defined as endometrial tissue located within the pelvic cavity, including any of the pelvic organs, peritoneum and pouch of Douglas. Ovarian endometriosis (endometrioma): defined as ovarian cysts lined by endometrial tissue and appearing as an ovarian mass of varying size. DIE: defined as subperitoneal infiltration of endometrial implants, for example, when endometriotic implants penetrate the retroperitoneal space for a distance of 5 mm or more. Posterior DIE is the most common form of DIE, and both conditions are interchangeably reported. For the purpose of this review, we combined them as a single target condition \u2010 DIE/posterior DIE. In addition, the ability of diagnostic imaging to map endometriotic lesions at specific anatomical pelvic locations was evaluated. Anatomical locations included rectovaginal septum (RVS), uterosacral ligament (USL), vaginal wall, POD obliteration, anterior DIE, rectosigmoid colon and the entire bowel from ileum to rectum. These locations are defined in Table 3. Type of endometriosis Description Main clinical types of endometriosis Pelvic endometriosis Endometriotic lesions, deep or superficial, located at any site in pelvic/abdominal cavity: on the peritoneum, fallopian tubes, ovaries, uterus, bowel, bladder or PODa Ovarian endometriosis Ovarian cysts lined by endometrial tissue (endometrioma) DIEb Deep endometriotic lesions extending more than 5 mm under the peritoneum located at any site of pelvic/abdominal cavity Subtypes of deep endometriosis per anatomical localisationc Posterior DIE Deep endometriotic lesions involve \u2265 1 site of the posterior pelvic compartment (USLd RVSe, vaginal wall, bowel) and/or obliterate PODa USLd endometriosis Endometriotic lesions infiltrate uterosacral ligaments unilaterally or bilaterally RVSe endometriosis Deep endometriotic implants infiltrate the retroperitoneal area between posterior wall of vaginal mucosa and anterior wall of rectal muscularis Vaginal endometriosisf Endometriotic lesions infiltrate vaginal wall, particularly posterior vaginal fornix PODa obliteration Defined when the peritoneum of the PODa is only partially or no longer visible during surgery, and occurs as a result of adhesion formation; can be partial or complete, respectively Bowel endometriosis Endometriotic lesions infiltrating at least the muscular layer of the intestinal wall ileum \u2010 rectum; predominantly affects rectosigmoid colon Rectosigmoid endometriosis Endometriotic lesions infiltrating at least the muscular layer of the rectosigmoid colon; the most common form of bowel endometriosis Anterior DIE Deep endometriotic lesions located at any site of the anterior pelvic compartment (bladder \u00b1 anterior pouch) Rare types of endometriosis (not included in this review) Bladder endometriosis Endometriotic lesions infiltrating bladder muscularis propria Ureteral endometriosis Endometriotic lesions involving ureters Extrapelvic/Atypical endometriosis Rare types of endometriosis involving various sites outside pelvic cavity, such as: CNS: cerebral endometriosis, extradural spinal endometriosis Thoracic: pleural endometriosis, pulmonary endometriosis, diaphragmatic endometriosis Abdominal: hepatic endometriosis, renal endometriosis, appendix endometriosis, pancreas endometriosis Musculoskeletal: abdominal wall endometriosis, umbilical endometriosis, pyramidalis muscle endometriosis, inguinal endometriosis, canal of Nuck endometriosis Perianal endometriosis, perineal endometriosis, extrapelvic endometriosis of sciatic nerve Subcutaneous endometriosis, operative scar endometriosis aDIE: deep infiltrating endometriosis bPOD: pouch of Douglas cDefinitions of subtypes of DIE are adopted from Bazot 2007c. Additional definitions presented in the literature include 'Rectovaginal endometriosis (RVE)' defined as DIE that infiltrates the vagina, rectum and RVS and obliterates POD (Martin 2001) or 'deep retrocervical endometriosis' defined as involvement of USL, torus uterini, posterior vaginal fornix and/or RVS by endometriotic lesions (Abrao 2007). dUSL: uterosacral ligament eRVS: rectovaginal septum fVaginal endometriosis also defined as 'lesions infiltrating the anterior rectovaginal pouch, posterior vaginal fornix and retroperitoneal area between anterior rectovaginal pouch and posterior vaginal fornix (Chapron 2003a) Certain rare types of endometriosis such as extrapelvic, bladder and ureteric endometriosis were not included in this review because most of these were described in case reports or in case series, and laparoscopy and laparotomy are not reliable reference standards for these conditions. We excluded studies in which the diagnosis of endometriosis was not the primary outcome of the trial (e.g. malignant vs benign masses, normal vs abnormal pelvis) and separate data for endometriosis were not available. We also excluded studies in which findings of the index test formed the basis of selection for the reference standard because this was likely to distort any assessment of the diagnostic value of the index test. We included studies that involved only selected populations of women with endometriosis (i.e. at specific rASRM stages), in view of emerging evidence on poor correlation of this classification with infertility and pain symptoms. Exclusion of these studies could result in loss of potentially important diagnostic information from otherwise eligible publications. When possible, we addressed the impact of these studies in investigations of heterogeneity. When a study analysed a large population with a wide spectrum of endometriosis and additionally reported subgroup analyses of different stages of disease severity, we considered only estimates for the entire population because subgroup analyses do not directly address the review question regarding clinical utility of biomarkers in detecting the disease.",
        "Reference standards": "The reference standard was visualisation of endometriosis at surgery (laparoscopy or laparotomy) with or without histological confirmation, as this is currently the best available test for endometriosis. We reviewed information regarding interobserver and intraobserver correlation of the reference standard, if reported. We included only studies in which the reference test was performed within 12 months of the index test, on the assumption that disease status could change within a period of one year or longer, naturally or as a result of treatment. We did not include in this review studies in which the participants did not undergo the reference standard, or for whom findings of the index test formed the basis of selection for the reference standard.
