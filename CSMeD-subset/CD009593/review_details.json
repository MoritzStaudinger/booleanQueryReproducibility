    "title": "Xpert Ultra versus Xpert MTB/RIF for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults with presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis",
    "abstract": "Background Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) are World Health Organization (WHO)\u2010recommended rapid tests that simultaneously detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in people with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis. This review builds on our recent extensive Cochrane Review of Xpert MTB/RIF accuracy.    Objectives To compare the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF for the detection of pulmonary tuberculosis and detection of rifampicin resistance in adults with presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis. For pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance, we also investigated potential sources of heterogeneity.  We also summarized the frequency of Xpert Ultra trace\u2010positive results, and estimated the accuracy of Xpert Ultra after repeat testing in those with trace\u2010positive results.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, Web of Science, LILACS, Scopus, the WHO ICTRP, the ISRCTN registry, and ProQuest to 28 January 2020 with no language restriction.    Selection criteria We included diagnostic accuracy studies using respiratory specimens in adults with presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis that directly compared the index tests. For pulmonary tuberculosis detection, the reference standards were culture and a composite reference standard. For rifampicin resistance, the reference standards were culture\u2010based drug susceptibility testing and line probe assays.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form, including data by smear and HIV status. We assessed risk of bias using QUADAS\u20102 and QUADAS\u2010C. We performed meta\u2010analyses comparing pooled sensitivities and specificities, separately for pulmonary tuberculosis detection and rifampicin resistance detection, and separately by reference standard. Most analyses used a bivariate random\u2010effects model. For tuberculosis detection, we estimated accuracy in studies in participants who were not selected based on prior microscopy testing or history of tuberculosis. We performed subgroup analyses by smear status, HIV status, and history of tuberculosis. We summarized Xpert Ultra trace results.    Main results We identified nine studies (3500 participants): seven had unselected participants (2834 participants). All compared Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF for pulmonary tuberculosis detection; seven studies used a paired comparative accuracy design, and two studies used a randomized design. Five studies compared Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance detection; four studies used a paired design, and one study used a randomized design. Of the nine included studies, seven (78%) were mainly or exclusively in high tuberculosis burden countries. For pulmonary tuberculosis detection, most studies had low risk of bias in all domains.  Pulmonary tuberculosis detection  Xpert Ultra pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% credible interval) against culture were 90.9% (86.2 to 94.7) and 95.6% (93.0 to 97.4) (7 studies, 2834 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence) versus Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity of 84.7% (78.6 to 89.9) and 98.4% (97.0 to 99.3) (7 studies, 2835 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence). The difference in the accuracy of Xpert Ultra minus Xpert MTB/RIF was estimated at 6.3% (0.1 to 12.8) for sensitivity and \u22122.7% (\u22125.7 to \u22120.5) for specificity. If the point estimates for Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF are applied to a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients, where 10% of those presenting with symptoms have pulmonary tuberculosis, Xpert Ultra will miss 9 cases, and Xpert MTB/RIF will miss 15 cases. The number of people wrongly diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis would be 40 with Xpert Ultra and 14 with Xpert MTB/RIF.  In smear\u2010negative, culture\u2010positive participants, pooled sensitivity was 77.5% (67.6 to 85.6) for Xpert Ultra versus 60.6% (48.4 to 71.7) for Xpert MTB/RIF; pooled specificity was 95.8% (92.9 to 97.7) for Xpert Ultra versus 98.8% (97.7 to 99.5) for Xpert MTB/RIF (6 studies).  In people living with HIV, pooled sensitivity was 87.6% (75.4 to 94.1) for Xpert Ultra versus 74.9% (58.7 to 86.2) for Xpert MTB/RIF; pooled specificity was 92.8% (82.3 to 97.0) for Xpert Ultra versus 99.7% (98.6 to 100.0) for Xpert MTB/RIF (3 studies).  In participants with a history of tuberculosis, pooled sensitivity was 84.2% (72.5 to 91.7) for Xpert Ultra versus 81.8% (68.7 to 90.0) for Xpert MTB/RIF; pooled specificity was 88.2% (70.5 to 96.6) for Xpert Ultra versus 97.4% (91.7 to 99.5) for Xpert MTB/RIF (4 studies).  The proportion of Ultra trace\u2010positive results ranged from 3.0% to 30.4%. Data were insufficient to estimate the accuracy of Xpert Ultra repeat testing in individuals with initial trace\u2010positive results.  Rifampicin resistance detection  Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 94.9% (88.9 to 97.9) and 99.1% (97.7 to 99.8) (5 studies, 921 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence) for Xpert Ultra versus 95.3% (90.0 to 98.1) and 98.8% (97.2 to 99.6) (5 studies, 930 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence) for Xpert MTB/RIF. The difference in the accuracy of Xpert Ultra minus Xpert MTB/RIF was estimated at \u22120.3% (\u22126.9 to 5.7) for sensitivity and 0.3% (\u22121.2 to 2.0) for specificity. If the point estimates for Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF are applied to a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients, where 10% of those presenting with symptoms have rifampicin resistance, Xpert Ultra will miss 5 cases, and Xpert MTB/RIF will miss 5 cases. The number of people wrongly diagnosed with rifampicin resistance would be 8 with Xpert Ultra and 11 with Xpert MTB/RIF.  We identified a higher number of rifampicin resistance indeterminate results with Xpert Ultra, pooled proportion 7.6% (2.4 to 21.0) compared to Xpert MTB/RIF pooled proportion 0.8% (0.2 to 2.4). The estimated difference in the pooled proportion of indeterminate rifampicin resistance results for Xpert Ultra versus Xpert MTB/RIF was 6.7% (1.4 to 20.1).    Authors' conclusions Xpert Ultra has higher sensitivity and lower specificity than Xpert MTB/RIF for pulmonary tuberculosis, especially in smear\u2010negative participants and people living with HIV. Xpert Ultra specificity was lower than that of Xpert MTB/RIF in participants with a history of tuberculosis. The sensitivity and specificity trade\u2010off would be expected to vary by setting. For detection of rifampicin resistance, Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF had similar sensitivity and specificity. Ultra trace\u2010positive results were common.  Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF provide accurate results and can allow rapid initiation of treatment for rifampicin\u2010resistant and multidrug\u2010resistant tuberculosis.",

        "Types of studies": "We included cross\u2010sectional and cohort type diagnostic accuracy studies that directly compared the index tests in participants with presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis. These study designs included paired and randomized comparative accuracy studies. Paired comparative accuracy studies are those in which each participant receives both index tests. Randomized comparative accuracy studies are those which randomly allocate participants to index tests, with each participant receiving only one index test. 'Presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis' refers to a patient who presents with symptoms or signs suggestive of tuberculosis. We included studies where the index tests were evaluated for both pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance, pulmonary tuberculosis alone, or rifampicin resistance alone. We also included randomized controlled trials that evaluated the use of the index(s) test on patient health outcomes, but that also reported sensitivity and specificity. Although the study design was a randomized trial for the purpose of determining the impact of the test on participant outcomes, the study design was a cross\u2010sectional study for the purpose of determining the diagnostic accuracy of the index tests in this review. However, we did not identify any randomized controlled trials. We used abstracts to identify published studies and included these publications if they met our inclusion criteria. We only included studies that reported data comparing the index test(s) to an acceptable reference standard from which we could extract true\u2010positive (TP), true\u2010negative (TN), false\u2010positive (FP), and false\u2010negative (FN) values. The index tests could be assessed alone or together with other tests. We included studies that evaluated the index tests in HIV\u2010positive people irrespective of tuberculosis symptoms, for example HIV\u2010positive people being assessed for antiretroviral therapy. We included these studies for the following reasons: the risk of developing tuberculosis is much higher in people living with HIV, estimated to be 20 to 37 times higher in HIV\u2010positive individuals than in HIV\u2010negative individuals (Getahun 2010); signs and symptoms of tuberculosis in people living with HIV vary, which makes it challenging to determine when to consider a diagnosis of tuberculosis; and many HIV\u2010positive people in low\u2010income countries develop tuberculosis as the first manifestation of AIDS. We excluded case reports and studies with a case\u2010control design, the latter because these types of studies are prone to bias, particularly studies enrolling participants with severe disease and healthy participants without disease. We excluded studies of the index tests in people with diabetes but without tuberculosis symptoms, and studies designed to find people with active tuberculosis in community settings. We excluded drug resistance surveys.",
        "Participants": "We included studies that enrolled adults, aged 15 years or older, with presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis, rifampicin\u2010resistant tuberculosis, or MDR\u2010TB. For tuberculosis detection, we were interested in people who were not currently on tuberculosis treatment or those on treatment for less than seven days. Tuberculosis treatment might interfere with the confirmation of tuberculosis on culture (the reference standard for this review). If the treatment status of the participants was unclear, we contacted primary study authors for this information. We included studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF using sputum and other respiratory specimens, such as fluid obtained from bronchial alveolar lavage and tracheal aspiration, consistent with the intended use of the manufacturer (Cepheid 2018), and studies from all types of health facilities and all laboratory levels (peripheral, intermediate, and central) from all countries. We excluded studies where the age of the participants was unknown.",

        "Target conditions": "The target conditions were active pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance.",
        "Reference standards": "For pulmonary tuberculosis, the reference standards were solid culture or automated liquid culture. Pulmonary tuberculosis present was defined as a positive M tuberculosis culture.    Pulmonary tuberculosis absent was defined as a negative M tuberculosis culture. Pulmonary tuberculosis present was defined as a positive M tuberculosis culture. Pulmonary tuberculosis absent was defined as a negative M tuberculosis culture. We also included a composite reference standard. The diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was defined as a positive culture or clinical criteria specified by the primary study authors. Clinical criteria might include cough longer than two weeks, fever, night sweats, or weight loss and radiographic findings consistent with pulmonary tuberculosis. Pulmonary tuberculosis present was defined as a positive M tuberculosis culture or meeting composite reference standard criteria.    Pulmonary tuberculosis absent was defined as a negative M tuberculosis culture and not meeting composite reference standard criteria. Pulmonary tuberculosis present was defined as a positive M tuberculosis culture or meeting composite reference standard criteria. Pulmonary tuberculosis absent was defined as a negative M tuberculosis culture and not meeting composite reference standard criteria. For rifampicin resistance, the reference standards were culture\u2010based drug susceptibility testing (DST), and line probe assays (LPA) (WHO Consolidated Guidelines (Module 3) 2020). Acceptable methods for DST are the proportion method, performed on solid media, such as Lowenstein\u2010Jensen, and use of a commercial liquid culture system, such as Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) 960 automated mycobacterial detection system (BD, USA). Rifampicin resistance present was defined as a positive culture\u2010based DST (or LPA) result for resistance.    Rifampicin resistance absent was defined as a negative culture\u2010based DST (or LPA) result for resistance (i.e. rifampicin susceptible). Rifampicin resistance present was defined as a positive culture\u2010based DST (or LPA) result for resistance. Rifampicin resistance absent was defined as a negative culture\u2010based DST (or LPA) result for resistance (i.e. rifampicin susceptible)."

        "Appendix 3. Rules for QUADAS\u20102 and QUADAS\u2010C": "In QUADAS\u20102, we assessed methodological quality separately for each of the objectives, Xpert for pulmonary tuberculosis detection and Xpert for rifampicin resistance detection.   Domain 1: Patient selection  Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF for pulmonary tuberculosis detection Risk of bias: Could the selection of patients have introduced bias? Signalling question 1: Was a consecutive or random sample of patients enrolled? We answered \u2018yes' if the study enrolled a consecutive or random sample of eligible patients; \u2018no' if the study selected patients by convenience; and \u2018unclear' if the study did not report the manner of patient selection or we could not tell.  Signalling question 2: Was a case\u2010control design avoided? Studies using a case\u2010control design were not included in the review because this study design, especially when used to compare results in severely ill patients with those in relatively healthy individuals, may lead to overestimation of accuracy in diagnostic studies. We answered \u2018yes' for all studies.  Signalling question 3: Did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions? We answered \u2018yes' if the study included both smear\u2010positive and smear\u2010negative individuals; \u2018no' if the study included primarily or exclusively smear\u2010positive or smear\u2010negative patients; and \u2018unclear' if we could not tell. We also answered \u2018no' if the study included primarily or exclusively patients who had undergone previous treatment (retreatment patients).  In our 'Risk of bias' judgement, we also considered the condition of the specimen, and whether the study used fresh or frozen specimens.  Applicability: Are there concerns that the included patients and setting do not match the review question?  We were interested in how Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra performed in patients who were evaluated as they would be in routine practice. We answered \u2018low concern' if patients were evaluated in local hospitals or primary care centres. We answered \u2018high concern' if patients were evaluated exclusively as inpatients in tertiary care centres or if the setting did not match the review question, for example using the index for decisions about the need for airborne isolation. We answered \u2018unclear concern' if the clinical setting was not reported or information was insufficient to make a decision. We also answered \u2018unclear concern' if Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra testing was done at a central\u2010level laboratory, and the clinical setting was not reported for the following reason: it was difficult to tell if a given reference laboratory provided services mainly to very sick patients.    Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance detection Domain 1: Patient selection is the same as for Xpert for pulmonary tuberculosis detection except for the following.  Signalling question 3: Did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions? We answered \u2018yes' if the study included both smear\u2010positive and smear\u2010negative individuals; \u2018no' if the study included primarily or exclusively smear\u2010positive or smear\u2010negative patients; and \u2018unclear' if we could not tell. We answered \u2018yes' if the study included primarily or exclusively retreatment patients because the group at risk for rifampicin resistance includes patients who had undergone previous treatment.     Domain 2: Index test  Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF for pulmonary tuberculosis detection Risk of bias: Could the conduct or interpretation of the index test have introduced bias?  Signalling question 1: Were the index test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard? We answered this question \u2018yes' for all studies because Xpert test results were automatically generated, and the user was provided with printable test results, thus there is no room for subjective interpretation of test results.  Signalling question 2: If a threshold was used, was it prespecified? The threshold was prespecified in all versions of Xpert. We answered this question \u2018yes' for all studies.  For risk of bias, we judged \u2018low concern' for all studies. Applicability: Are there concerns that the index test, its conduct, or its interpretation differ from the review question? Variations in test technology, execution, or interpretation may affect estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of a test. All steps in the Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra assays are completely automated and self\u2010contained following sample loading. We answered \u2018low concern' if the index test was performed as recommended by the manufacturer, which was true for most studies. We answered \u2018unclear concern' if the ratio of the Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF sample reagent: specimen volume was not 2:1 for a raw specimen or 3:1 for a sediment, as recommended by the manufacturer. Central\u2010level laboratories use more highly trained staff than peripheral and intermediate\u2010level laboratories. However, we did not consider this to be a concern about applicability because, in some studies, the reason the index test was performed in a central\u2010level laboratory was the requirement for a sophisticated laboratory infrastructure to perform culture (reference standard) not to perform Xpert.    Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance detection Domain 2: Index test is the same as for Xpert for pulmonary tuberculosis detection.    Domain 3: Reference standard  Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF for pulmonary tuberculosis detection Risk of bias: Could the reference standard, its conduct, or its interpretation have introduced bias?  Signalling question 1: Is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition?  For the reference standard, all studies used culture, which is generally considered to be the best reference standard for tuberculosis. Two studies used a composite reference standard in addition to culture. We answered this signalling question 'yes' for all studies.  Signalling question 2: Were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index test?  We answered \u2018yes' if the reference test provided an automated result (e.g. MGIT 960), blinding was explicitly stated, or it was clear that the reference standard was performed at a separate laboratory and/or performed by different people. We answered \u2018no' if the study stated that the reference standard result was interpreted with knowledge of the index test result. We answered \u2018unclear' if we could not tell.  Applicability: Are there concerns that the target condition as defined by the reference standard does not match the question? We answered \u2018high concern' if the included studies did not speciate mycobacteria isolated in culture; \u2018low concern' if speciation was performed; and \u2018unclear concern' if we could not tell.    Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance detection Risk of bias: Could the selection of patients have introduced bias? Signalling question 1: Is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition?  We answered \u2018yes' if either culture\u2010based drug susceptibility testing or a line probe assay such as MTBDRplus was used. These were criteria for inclusion for this objective of the review.  Signalling question 2: Were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index test?  We answered \u2018yes' if the reference test provided an automated result (e.g. MGIT 960), blinding was explicitly stated, or it was clear that the reference standard was performed at a separate laboratory and/or performed by different people. We answered \u2018no' if the study stated that the reference standard result was interpreted with knowledge of the Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF test result. We answered \u2018unclear' if we could not tell.  Applicability: Are there concerns that the target condition as defined by the reference standard does not match the question? We judged applicability to be of \u2018low concern' for those studies evaluating Xpert for rifampicin resistance because these specimens had already been identified as Mycobacterium tuberculosis positive.     Domain 4: Flow and timing  Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF for pulmonary tuberculosis detection Risk of bias: Could the patient flow have introduced bias? Signalling question 1: Was there an appropriate interval between the index test and reference standard? We expected that in most included studies specimens for Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra and culture would be obtained at the same time, when patients were evaluated for presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis. However, even if there was a delay of several days between index test and reference standard, tuberculosis is a chronic disease, and we considered misclassification of disease status to be unlikely, as long as treatment was not initiated in the interim. We answered \u2018yes' if the index test and reference standard were performed at the same time, or if the time interval was less than or equal to seven days; \u2018no' if the time interval was greater than seven days; or \u2018unclear' if we could not tell.  Signalling question 2: Did all patients receive the same reference standard? We answered this question \u2018yes' for all studies, as an acceptable reference standard (either solid or liquid culture) was specified as a criterion for inclusion in the review. We acknowledge that it is possible that some specimens could undergo solid culture and others liquid culture, which could potentially result in variations in accuracy; however, we thought the variation would be minimal.  Signalling question 3: Were all patients included in the analysis? We determined the answer to this question by comparing the number of patients enrolled with the number of patients included in the 2 x 2 tables. We answered \u2018yes' if the numbers matched, and \u2018no' if there were patients enrolled in the study that were not included in the analysis. We answered \u2018unclear' if we could not tell.    Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance detection Domain 4: Flow and timing is the same as for Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF for pulmonary tuberculosis detection.  Judgements for \u2018Risk of bias' assessments for a given domain are as follows.    If we answered all signalling questions for a domain \u2018yes', then we judged risk of bias as \u2018low'.    If we answered all or most signalling questions for a domain \u2018no', then we judged risk of bias as \u2018high'.    If we answered only one signalling question for a domain \u2018no', we further discussed the \u2018Risk of bias' judgement.    If we answered all or most signalling questions for a domain \u2018unclear', then we judged risk of bias as \u2018unclear'.    If we answered only one signalling question for a domain \u2018unclear', we further discussed the \u2018Risk of bias' judgement for the domain.

We answered \u2018yes' if the reference test provided an automated result (e.g. MGIT 960), blinding was explicitly stated, or it was clear that the reference standard was performed at a separate laboratory and/or performed by different people. We answered \u2018no' if the study stated that the reference standard result was interpreted with knowledge of the index test result. We answered \u2018unclear' if we could not tell.  Applicability: Are there concerns that the target condition as defined by the reference standard does not match the question? We answered \u2018high concern' if the included studies did not speciate mycobacteria isolated in culture; \u2018low concern' if speciation was performed; and \u2018unclear concern' if we could not tell.    Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance detection Risk of bias: Could the selection of patients have introduced bias? Signalling question 1: Is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition?  We answered \u2018yes' if either culture\u2010based drug susceptibility testing or a line probe assay such as MTBDRplus was used. These were criteria for inclusion for this objective of the review.  Signalling question 2: Were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index test?  We answered \u2018yes' if the reference test provided an automated result (e.g. MGIT 960), blinding was explicitly stated, or it was clear that the reference standard was performed at a separate laboratory and/or performed by different people. We answered \u2018no' if the study stated that the reference standard result was interpreted with knowledge of the Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF test result. We answered \u2018unclear' if we could not tell.  Applicability: Are there concerns that the target condition as defined by the reference standard does not match the question? We judged applicability to be of \u2018low concern' for those studies evaluating Xpert for rifampicin resistance because these specimens had already been identified as Mycobacterium tuberculosis positive.",
        "Domain 4: Flow and timing": "Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF for pulmonary tuberculosis detection Risk of bias: Could the patient flow have introduced bias? Signalling question 1: Was there an appropriate interval between the index test and reference standard? We expected that in most included studies specimens for Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra and culture would be obtained at the same time, when patients were evaluated for presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis. However, even if there was a delay of several days between index test and reference standard, tuberculosis is a chronic disease, and we considered misclassification of disease status to be unlikely, as long as treatment was not initiated in the interim. We answered \u2018yes' if the index test and reference standard were performed at the same time, or if the time interval was less than or equal to seven days; \u2018no' if the time interval was greater than seven days; or \u2018unclear' if we could not tell.  Signalling question 2: Did all patients receive the same reference standard? We answered this question \u2018yes' for all studies, as an acceptable reference standard (either solid or liquid culture) was specified as a criterion for inclusion in the review. We acknowledge that it is possible that some specimens could undergo solid culture and others liquid culture, which could potentially result in variations in accuracy; however, we thought the variation would be minimal.  Signalling question 3: Were all patients included in the analysis? We determined the answer to this question by comparing the number of patients enrolled with the number of patients included in the 2 x 2 tables. We answered \u2018yes' if the numbers matched, and \u2018no' if there were patients enrolled in the study that were not included in the analysis. We answered \u2018unclear' if we could not tell.    Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance detection  is the same as for Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF for pulmonary tuberculosis detection.  Judgements for \u2018Risk of bias' assessments for a given domain are as follows.    If we answered all signalling questions for a domain \u2018yes', then we judged risk of bias as \u2018low'.    If we answered all or most signalling questions for a domain \u2018no', then we judged risk of bias as \u2018high'.    If we answered only one signalling question for a domain \u2018no', we further discussed the \u2018Risk of bias' judgement.    If we answered all or most signalling questions for a domain \u2018unclear', then we judged risk of bias as \u2018unclear'.    If we answered only one signalling question for a domain \u2018unclear', we further discussed the \u2018Risk of bias' judgement for the domain.",

The hierarchical framework took into account heterogeneity between studies and also between centres within two of the largest studies.
