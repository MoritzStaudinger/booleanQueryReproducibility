    "title": "Computed tomography (CT) angiography for confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of brain death",
    "abstract": "Background The diagnosis of death using neurological criteria (brain death) has profound social, legal and ethical implications. The diagnosis can be made using standard clinical tests examining for brain function, but in some patient populations and in some countries additional tests may be required. Computed tomography (CT) angiography, which is currently in wide clinical use, has been identified as one such test.    Objectives To assess from the current literature the sensitivity of CT cerebral angiography as an additional confirmatory test for diagnosing death using neurological criteria, following satisfaction of clinical neurological criteria for brain death.    Search methods We performed comprehensive literature searches to identify studies that would assess the diagnostic accuracy of CT angiography (the index test) in cohorts of adult patients, using the diagnosis of brain death according to neurological criteria as the target condition. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 5) and the following databases from January 1992 to August 2012: MEDLINE; EMBASE; BNI; CINAHL; ISI Web of Science; BioMed Central. We also conducted searches in regional electronic bibliographic databases and subject\u2010specific databases (MEDION; IndMed; African Index Medicus). A search was also conducted in Google Scholar where we reviewed the first 100 results only. We handsearched reference lists and conference proceedings to identify primary studies and review articles. Abstracts were identified by two authors. Methodological assessment of studies using the QUADAS\u20102 tool and further data extraction for re\u2010analysis were performed by three authors.    Selection criteria We included in this review all large case series and cohort studies that compared the results of CT angiography with the diagnosis of brain death according to neurological criteria. Uniquely, the reference standard was the same as the target condition in this review.    Data collection and analysis We reviewed all included studies for methodological quality according to the QUADAS\u20102 criteria.\u00a0We encountered significant heterogeneity in methods used to interpret CT angiography studies and therefore, where possible, we re\u2010analysed the published data to conform to a standard radiological interpretation model. The majority of studies (with one exception) were not designed to include patients who were not brain dead, and therefore overall specificity was not estimable as part of a meta\u2010analysis. Sensitivity, confidence and prediction intervals were calculated for both as\u2010published data and as re\u2010analysed to a standardized interpretation model.    Main results Ten studies were found including 366 patients in total. We included eight studies in the as\u2010published data analysis, comprising 337 patients .\u00a0The methodological quality of the studies was overall satisfactory, however there was potential for introduction of significant bias in several specific areas relating to performance of the index test and to the timing of index versus reference tests.\u00a0Results demonstrated a sensitivity estimate of 0.84 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 0.93). The 95% approximate prediction interval was very wide (0.34 to 0.98). Data in three studies were available as a four\u2010vessel interpretation model and the data could be re\u2010analysed to a four\u2010vessel interpretation model in a further five studies, comprising 314 patient events. Results demonstrated a similar sensitivity estimate of 0.85 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.91) but with an improved 95% approximate prediction interval (0.56 to 0.96).    Authors' conclusions The available evidence cannot support the use of CT angiography as a mandatory test, or as a complete replacement for neurological testing, in the management pathway of patients who are suspected to be clinically brain dead.\u00a0CT angiography may be useful as a confirmatory or add\u2010on test following a clinical diagnosis of death, assuming that clinicians are aware of the relatively low overall sensitivity. Consensus on a standard radiological interpretation protocol for future published studies would facilitate further meta\u2010analysis.",

        "Types of studies": "We included studies of patient populations, published in all languages.\u00a0If relevant non\u2010English articles were identified but full\u2010text translations could not be obtained in press, we placed them in the 'Studies awaiting assessment' section and sought help from colleagues within The Cochrane Collaboration to obtain accurate translations. We considered studies to be acceptable if: the studies compared cerebral CTA (with or without other imaging or ancillary tests) with a clinical diagnosis of brain death, that is satisfaction of accepted clinical neurological criteria to diagnose death;    the participant population was defined as those in whom either a clinical diagnosis of brain death had already been made or a clinical diagnosis of brain death was established as part of the study;    the absolute numbers of true and false positives, and true and false negatives, were either available directly from the published study data, secondarily derivable from data within the published study or as supplementary published material, or available directly from the original study authors.\u00a0Although at the outset we sought to collect data regarding numbers of true negatives and false positives from studies, it rapidly became apparent from a preliminary review of the literature that all but one of the published studies included no control group. the studies compared cerebral CTA (with or without other imaging or ancillary tests) with a clinical diagnosis of brain death, that is satisfaction of accepted clinical neurological criteria to diagnose death; the participant population was defined as those in whom either a clinical diagnosis of brain death had already been made or a clinical diagnosis of brain death was established as part of the study; the absolute numbers of true and false positives, and true and false negatives, were either available directly from the published study data, secondarily derivable from data within the published study or as supplementary published material, or available directly from the original study authors.\u00a0Although at the outset we sought to collect data regarding numbers of true negatives and false positives from studies, it rapidly became apparent from a preliminary review of the literature that all but one of the published studies included no control group. Other comparator tests were not reviewed as part of this study.\u00a0We anticipated that many studies would include at least one other imaging or investigative comparator test; if these studies fulfilled our criteria for acceptance they were included. In some studies, cerebral CTA may have been considered as a reference test and a further clinical test compared against it. Our search strategy was tailored to include these studies, however they were not included unless they provided a statement to the effect that 'all included patients satisfied a clinical diagnosis of brain death', or similar, allowing cerebral CTA to be viewed as an index test against the reference test of clinical testing. We planned to contact authors of any such studies to obtain relevant supplementary data. Studies ideally defined clinical and imaging variables that were employed as part of their methodology.\u00a0In particular, if details of the following were not specifically included we contacted the author(s) for further details. Time interval from reference standard to CTA (or vice versa)   Evidence of blinding of clinicians, reporters of CT angiography, reference standard findings Time interval from reference standard to CTA (or vice versa) Evidence of blinding of clinicians, reporters of CT angiography, reference standard findings Criteria used for diagnosis of brain death (including country of origin, name of approving regulatory body if applicable)    Experience of clinician(s) Criteria used for diagnosis of brain death (including country of origin, name of approving regulatory body if applicable) Experience of clinician(s) Contrast dose, contrast volume, acquisition volume, scanner type (single spiral or multislice), study time Contrast dose, contrast volume, acquisition volume, scanner type (single spiral or multislice), study time Single, double, consensus reporting   Experience of reporter(s) Single, double, consensus reporting Experience of reporter(s) We excluded study reports that were written to focus on specific technical aspects of either the clinical or imaging technique. We also excluded commentary or opinion\u2010forming articles that did not have a clinical study component. In the case of multiple publications by the same author or group of authors with similar data, we contacted the author(s) to establish the degree of similarity within their described patient populations. If this was not possible, we included only the most recent or complete study. We considered it possible that we might encounter two patient subgroups in reviewed articles. That is: patients who had already received a diagnosis of clinical brain death prior to undergoing CTA;    patients who did not have a diagnosis of clinical brain death but were suspected to be in such a state at the time of CTA and who subsequently went on to receive a diagnosis of clinical brain death. patients who had already received a diagnosis of clinical brain death prior to undergoing CTA; patients who did not have a diagnosis of clinical brain death but were suspected to be in such a state at the time of CTA and who subsequently went on to receive a diagnosis of clinical brain death. It is possible that this temporal relationship may be of significance when looking for sources of heterogeneity, particularly as this review aimed to assess the role of CTA as an additional, confirmatory test rather than as a replacement, supplementary, triage or screening test. If sufficient data were available, we planned to perform a subgroup analysis for these two cohorts. However, this was not possible given sparse data.",

        "Participants": "We included patients in whom a diagnosis of brain death was suspected or in whom a clinical diagnosis of brain death had been made. We identified both adult and paediatric populations; this is consistent with the recommendations of the working party of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges 2008 that standard adult clinical criteria and testing can be used in those over two months of age to diagnose brain death. However, there are several physiological and procedural differences in the performance of CTA in the paediatric population, namely the volume of contrast administered (which is related to weight) and cardiac output. These factors may significantly affect the utility of CTA in the paediatric population and, therefore, we planned to analyse data for adult (over 16 years) and paediatric populations separately. No paediatric data were identified.",
        "Index tests": "The index test was cerebral CTA. Image acquisition and reporting variables were defined as listed above.",
        "Target conditions": "The target condition was the clinical diagnosis of brain death. Included studies needed to define the clinical method used to establish a diagnosis of brain death.",
        "Reference standards": "The reference standard was the diagnosis of brain death, which is in effect the same as the target condition. In order to reduce heterogeneity, we recorded the clinical method used to diagnose brain death. We contacted authors or established the legal requirements in the country of article authorship, or both, to establish this. We originally considered performing subgroup analysis between cohorts diagnosed according to a 'no brainstem function' clinical method and those diagnosed according to a 'no brain or brainstem function' clinical method, but subsequent paucity of data precluded this possibility."
