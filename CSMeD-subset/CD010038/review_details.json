    "abstract": "Background Childhood vaccination (also described as immunisation) is an important and effective way to reduce childhood illness and death. However, there are many children who do not receive the recommended vaccines because their parents do not know why vaccination is important, do not understand how, where or when to get their children vaccinated, disagree with vaccination as a public health measure, or have concerns about vaccine safety.  Face to face interventions to inform or educate parents about routine childhood vaccination may improve vaccination rates and parental knowledge or understanding of vaccination. Such interventions may describe or explain the practical and logistical factors associated with vaccination, and enable parents to understand the meaning and relevance of vaccination for their family or community.    Objectives To assess the effects of face to face interventions for informing or educating parents about early childhood vaccination on immunisation uptake and parental knowledge.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7); MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to July 2012); EMBASE + Embase Classic (OvidSP) (1947 to July 2012); CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (1981 to July 2012); PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to July 2012); Global Health (CAB) (1910 to July 2012); Global Health Library (WHO) (searched July 2012); Google Scholar (searched September 2012), ISI Web of Science (searched September 2012) and reference lists of relevant articles. We searched for ongoing trials in The International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (searched August 2012) and for grey literature in The Grey Literature Report and OpenGrey (searched August 2012). We also contacted authors of included studies and experts in the field. There were no language or date restrictions.    Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs evaluating the effects of face to face interventions delivered to individual parents or groups of parents to inform or educate about early childhood vaccination, compared with control or with another face to face intervention. Early childhood vaccines are all recommended routine childhood vaccines outlined by the World Health Organization, with the exception of human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) which is delivered to adolescents.    Data collection and analysis Two authors independently reviewed database search results for inclusion. Grey literature searches were conducted and reviewed by a single author. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We contacted study authors for additional information.    Main results We included six RCTs and one cluster RCT involving a total of 2978 participants. Three studies were conducted in low\u2010 or middle\u2010income countries and four were conducted in high\u2010income countries. The cluster RCT did not contribute usable data to the review. The interventions comprised a mix of single\u2010session and multi\u2010session strategies. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was low to very low and the studies were at moderate risk of bias overall. All these trials compared face to face interventions directed to individual parents with control.  The three studies assessing the effect of a single\u2010session intervention on immunisation status could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity. The overall result is uncertain because the individual study results ranged from no evidence of effect to a significant increase in immunisation.  Two studies assessed the effect of a multi\u2010session intervention on immunisation status. These studies were also not pooled due to heterogeneity and the result was very uncertain, ranging from a non\u2010significant decrease in immunisation to no evidence of effect.  The two studies assessing the effect of a face to face intervention on knowledge or understanding of vaccination were very uncertain and were not pooled as data from one study were skewed. However, neither study showed evidence of an effect on knowledge scores in the intervention group. Only one study measured the cost of a case management intervention. The estimated additional cost per fully immunised child for the intervention was approximately eight times higher than usual care.  The review also considered the following secondary outcomes: intention to vaccinate child, parent experience of intervention, and adverse effects. No adverse effects related to the intervention were measured by any of the included studies, and there were no data on the other outcomes of interest.    Authors' conclusions The limited evidence available is low quality and suggests that face to face interventions to inform or educate parents about childhood vaccination have little to no impact on immunisation status, or knowledge or understanding of vaccination. There is insufficient evidence to comment on the cost of implementing the intervention, parent intention to vaccinate, parent experience of the intervention, or adverse effects. Given the apparently limited effect of such interventions, it may be feasible and appropriate to incorporate communication about vaccination into a healthcare encounter, rather than conduct it as a separate activity.",

        "Types of participants": "Communication interventions about childhood vaccination are complex because multiple participant groups are involved in the intervention. The intervention is delivered to one group (parents) to promote vaccination, which is administered to another group (children). The planning and implementation of the intervention or the immunisation program itself is addressed by a third group (program organisers). The three participant groups are: Children: infants (less than 1 year) or preschool\u2010aged children (1 to 5 or 6 years). RCTs including school\u2010aged children were only included if the main focus of the intervention was those vaccines whose primary series begins in infancy or for preschool\u2010aged children.    Parents: parents, guardians or others fulfilling the parental role, alone or in groups, targeted to receive face to face information or education, and who have at least one child due or overdue for childhood vaccinations. Participants may also be expectant parents, who are individuals or couples currently pregnant, considering adoption or otherwise expecting to become guardians of a child. The intervention may be directed to parents individually or in groups.    Vaccine program organisers: anyone involved in the planning or implementation of immunisation programs or interventions.

        "Types of interventions": "Face to face communication interventions directed to parents to inform or educate them about routine childhood vaccinations. Such interventions describe or impart information about some feature of routine childhood vaccination with the purpose of changing consumer knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, behaviour or self\u2010efficacy. The type of content that may be covered includes information about: vaccine\u2010preventable diseases (eg symptoms, prevalence, transmission, severity); vaccines (eg delivery method, dose, ingredients, schedule, risks or side effects, benefits); or vaccine service delivery (eg where to go to receive vaccinations, costs, clinic opening hours, services to assist with access). Despite potential heterogeneity of intervention content or intensity across studies, we agreed that interventions with the purpose of informing or educating parents about vaccination were sufficiently similar to compare in this review. We included interventions delivered by anyone including physicians, nurses, or other healthcare professionals; trained volunteers; lay health workers; members of the community; peers; or health visitors. The term \u2018routine vaccinations\u2019 means all recommended routine childhood vaccines outlined by the WHO (WHO 2012) with the exception of human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV), which is delivered to adolescents. This review focuses only on interventions about early childhood vaccines because interventions related to vaccines for older children may be significantly different in nature (eg they may target children directly, or have a reduced focus on the parent's role in decision making). We included face to face interventions conducted in cluster RCTs in the context of a mass vaccination campaign if it was possible to isolate and report the effects of the face to face communication interventions delivered to parents for the vaccination of young children or infants from the larger campaign. Similarly, we included multi\u2010component interventions with a face to face element if the outcomes of the face to face intervention alone could be determined from the reported data. For example, trials of multi\u2010component interventions involving face to face education plus reminders or health service access assistance (Quinlivan 2003; Wood 1998) measured both immunisation uptake and knowledge. We could not isolate the effect of the face to face intervention on the immunisation rate but we could attribute any changes in knowledge to the face to face intervention alone. We may also be able to determine the effect of a face to face intervention if a trial measured outcomes at multiple time points, including one before the addition of other intervention types. Interventions were not considered to be multi\u2010component if a secondary form of information or education (eg a pamphlet) was provided along with the face to face intervention and was specifically described as supplementary or supporting. While screening our search output, we discovered that face to face education or information was often evaluated in the context of pre\u2010 or postnatal early parenting interventions, such as well child care appointments or home visits. In some cases, while immunisation status was measured as an outcome, the degree to which immunisation was addressed in the face to face sessions was not well described. Our process for determining inclusion or exclusion of such studies was as follows: If the trial specifically mentioned informing or educating about immunisation, however briefly, then it was included as long as it met the other inclusion criteria.    If the intervention did not mention immunisation at all (eg education about child development, or 'well baby visits') but did have an immunisation\u2010related outcome, we contacted the authors for more information. If we received no response from the authors, we excluded these studies. If the trial specifically mentioned informing or educating about immunisation, however briefly, then it was included as long as it met the other inclusion criteria. If the intervention did not mention immunisation at all (eg education about child development, or 'well baby visits') but did have an immunisation\u2010related outcome, we contacted the authors for more information. If we received no response from the authors, we excluded these studies. We took this approach because we could not be certain that immunisation was mentioned in the face to face intervention just because an immunisation outcome was measured. We were wary of diluting the true effect of purposeful immunisation information or education with studies that may not have covered immunisation topics. We welcome contact from any authors who believe their studies may have been erroneously excluded. The review addressed four comparisons. Face to face interventions directed to individual parents (mothers, fathers or couples) versus control (usual care or passive intervention, ie no intervention, pamphlet).    Face to face interventions directed to groups of parents versus control.   Face to face interventions directed to individuals versus face to face interventions directed to groups.    Face to face intervention A versus face to face intervention B.

Face to face interventions directed to groups of parents versus control. Face to face interventions directed to individuals versus face to face interventions directed to groups. Face to face intervention A versus face to face intervention B. Face to face interventions to inform or educate may include oral sessions; lectures; one on one or group classes or seminars; information sessions; home visits or outreach sessions. We did not include community\u2010directed interventions, as these are considered in S\u00e6terdal 2012.",
        "Types of outcome measures": "Children: Immunisation status of child (ie immunisation status up\u2010to\u2010date, or receipt of one or more vaccines, as defined by study authors)    Parents: Knowledge or understanding of vaccination Children: Immunisation status of child (ie immunisation status up\u2010to\u2010date, or receipt of one or more vaccines, as defined by study authors) Parents: Knowledge or understanding of vaccination Parents: Intention to vaccinate child   Parents: Parent experience of intervention (eg satisfaction, assessment of communication)   Vaccine program managers: Cost of implementing intervention   All categories: Adverse effects Parents: Intention to vaccinate child Parents: Parent experience of intervention (eg satisfaction, assessment of communication) Vaccine program managers: Cost of implementing intervention All categories: Adverse effects The wording of the first primary outcome was formulated to capture immunisation status, given that it is varyingly reported, following advice from colleagues in the vaccination and lay health worker area. The second primary outcome was selected because increasing people\u2019s knowledge and understanding of the benefits of vaccination is the stated purpose of many programs and interventions (see Appendix 1). The intended purpose is a useful and important way to describe interventions, as reflected in the taxonomy of interventions organised by purpose which was developed as a preliminary step for this review (Willis submitted). Furthermore, by considering knowledge and immunisation status equally, we acknowledge the tension between the desire to increase vaccination rates and a parent's right to choose not to vaccinate. We selected the secondary outcomes after consultation with program delivery experts within the review team, who recommended collecting data on proximal outcomes (eg intention to vaccinate) in consideration of the fact that external barriers may impact endpoint outcomes and obscure some effects of the intervention. Other secondary outcomes were chosen because they are factors that may be important to program delivery decision makers. Adverse events were included to capture any potential negative effects of the interventions \u2013 for example, anxiety or distress \u2010 and because it is Cochrane Collaboration policy for systematic reviews to consider adverse effects (Loke 2011). We did not conduct a full cost\u2010effectiveness analysis, but instead considered only cost data related to the intervention reported alongside effectiveness data in included trials. We did not include or exclude studies on the basis of measured outcomes.",

        "Appendix 3. Behaviour change theories and their application to vaccination": "Theory    Main points    Application to vaccination      Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura 1986)       Behaviour, environment, and knowledge are intertwined and act upon one another.   People acquire knowledge and change their behaviour based on observing their environment and the behaviour of others in their social context.    Self\u2010efficacy, a person\u2019s belief in their ability to perform a task, also affects their behaviour.          The vaccination behaviour of parents is influenced by their knowledge (which they have developed based on available and understandable information) as well as their social environment (the attitudes and behaviour of their peers or community).    Vaccination messages delivered face to face allow for interaction and information can be tailored to address specific social, and environmental, or personal self\u2010efficacy concerns.         Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) (Ajzen 1985)       The likelihood of behaviour change or uptake can be predicted based on three components:   Behavioural intention (BI).   Attitude (AB): personal beliefs about the behaviour.   Subjective norms (SN): the influence of others in a person\u2019s environment.     A person is likely to change their behaviour if they have the intention to change.         A face to face intervention to inform or educate parents about vaccination is likely to target the parent\u2019s attitude toward vaccination in order to influence their intention to vaccinate. However, if their subjective norm is highly contradictory to their personal attitudes (eg they live in a community where vaccination is not approved of) then positively influencing their attitude may not result in a change in vaccination behaviour. Receiving information from a trusted and respected source may help overcome negative subjective norms.         Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen 1991)       An extension of the TRA.   Addresses behaviours which are influenced by factors beyond a person\u2019s control.   The TPB adds the element of 'perceived behavioural control' (PBC), which is an individual\u2019s confidence in their ability to perform the behaviour.          Information intended to influence parental attitudes towards vaccination might differ from information to influence perceived behavioural control. PBC might be improved through provision of logistical information such as where, how, or when to vaccinate. Attitudes might be more affected by information about risks or benefits, or information delivered in an emotive manner.         Transtheoretical Model (TTM) (Prochaska 1997)       A model incorporating the concept of self\u2010efficacy to predict an individual\u2019s readiness or likelihood of acting on a behaviour.    The TTM is a stage model with five stages:   Precontemplation (the person is not intending to take action);   Contemplation (the person intends to change within the next 6 months);   Preparation (the person intends to act within the immediate future);   Action (the person has made some specific changes within the past 6 months); and   Maintenance (the person is working to avoid relapse).     Depending on which stage a person falls into, different interventions may be more or less effective at moving them closer to behaviour change.          Interventions may be tailored to the stage of readiness of the proposed audience. Inform or educate interventions explaining where to receive vaccines may be appropriate for people who are in the preparation stage, but people who are completely unaware of or uninterested in vaccination (precontemplation) may be influenced more by information about vaccine\u2010preventable diseases and the risks and benefits of vaccines. Reinforcement or reminders may be a feature of an intervention targeting people in the maintenance stage.         Health Belief Model (HBM) (Janz 1984)       Predicts how likely a person is to adopt or change a health behaviour in order to ameliorate a particular risk.    Developed to address preventive healthcare behaviour.   The HBM involves four constructs:   Perceived susceptibility (an individual\u2019s sense of vulnerability to a specific risk);   Perceived severity (how serious the person believes that risk to be);   Perceived benefits (the effectiveness and achievability of the proposed behaviour); and    Perceived barriers (negative effects of changing or adopting proposed behaviour).           Interventions can be targeted to act at any of the four levels of the model in order to influence behaviour. For example: providing images and stories of children experiencing serious effects from vaccine\u2010preventable diseases increases perceived severity, while education describing the effectiveness of vaccines influences the perceived benefits of vaccination.",
