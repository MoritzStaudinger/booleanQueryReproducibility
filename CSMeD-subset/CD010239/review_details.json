    "title": "Lower versus higher oxygen concentrations titrated to target oxygen saturations during resuscitation of preterm infants at birth",
    "abstract": "Background Initial resuscitation with air is well tolerated by most infants born at term. However, the optimal fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2 \u2010 proportion of the breathed air that is oxygen) targeted to oxygen saturation (SpO2 \u2010 an estimate of the amount of oxygen in the blood) for infants born preterm is unclear.    Objectives To determine whether lower or higher initial oxygen concentrations, when titrated according to oxygen saturation targets during the resuscitation of preterm infants at birth, lead to improved short\u2010 and long\u2010term mortality and morbidity.    Search methods We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (13 October 2017), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 13 October 2017), Embase (1974 to 13 October 2017) and CINAHL (1982 to 13 October 2017); we also searched previous reviews (including cross\u2010references), contacted expert informants, and handsearched journals.    Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (including cluster\u2010 and quasi\u2010randomised trials) which enrolled preterm infants requiring resuscitation following birth and allocated them to receive either lower (FiO2 < 0.4) or higher (FiO2 \u2265 0.4) initial oxygen concentrations titrated to target oxygen saturation.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Primary outcomes included mortality near term or at discharge (latest reported) and neurodevelopmental disability. We conducted meta\u2010analysis using a fixed\u2010effect model. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.    Main results The search identified 10 eligible trials. Meta\u2010analysis of the 10 included studies (914 infants) showed no difference in mortality to discharge between lower (FiO2 < 0.4) and higher (FiO2 \u2265 0.4) initial oxygen concentrations targeted to oxygen saturation (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 1.63). We identified no heterogeneity in this analysis. We graded the quality of the evidence as low due to risk of bias and imprecision. There were no significant subgroup effects according to inspired oxygen concentration strata (FiO2 0.21 versus \u2265 0.4 to < 0.6; FiO2 0.21 versus \u2265 0.6 to 1.0; and FiO2 \u2265 0.3 to < 0.4 versus \u2265 0.6 to 1.0). Subgroup analysis identified a single trial that reported increased mortality from use of lower (FiO2 0.21) versus higher (FiO2 1.0) initial oxygen concentration targeted to a lowest SpO2 of less than 85%, whereas meta\u2010analysis of nine trials targeting a lowest SpO2 of 85% to 90% found no difference in mortality.  Meta\u2010analysis of two trials (208 infants) showed no difference in neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months between infants receiving lower (FiO2 < 0.4) versus higher (FiO2 > 0.4) initial oxygen concentrations targeted to oxygen saturation. Other outcomes were incompletely reported by studies. Overall, we found no difference in use of intermittent positive pressure ventilation or intubation in the delivery room; retinopathy (damage to the retina of the eyes, measured as any retinopathy and severe retinopathy); intraventricular haemorrhage (any and severe); periventricular leukomalacia (a type of white\u2010matter brain injury); necrotising enterocolitis (a condition where a portion of the bowel dies); chronic lung disease at 36 weeks' gestation; mortality to follow up; postnatal growth failure; and patent ductus arteriosus. We graded the quality of the evidence for these outcomes as low or very low.    Authors' conclusions There is uncertainty as to whether initiating post birth resuscitation in preterm infants using lower (FiO2 < 0.4) or higher (FiO2 \u2265 0.4) oxygen concentrations, targeted to oxygen saturations in the first 10 minutes, has an important effect on mortality or major morbidity, intubation during post birth resuscitation, other resuscitation outcomes, and long\u2010term outcomes including neurodevelopmental disability. We assessed the quality of the evidence for all outcomes as low to very low. Further large, well designed trials are needed to assess the effect of using different initial oxygen concentrations and the effect of targeting different oxygen saturations.",

        "Appendix 2. Risk of bias tool": "The following issues were evaluated and entered into the risk of bias table: 1. Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?   For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:     low risk (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);    high risk (any non\u2010random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or    unclear risk.    2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?   For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:     low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);    high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non\u2010opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); or    unclear risk    3. Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?   For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or class of outcomes. We categorized the methods as:     low risk, high risk or unclear risk for participants; and   low risk, high risk or unclear risk for personnel.    4. Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented at the time of outcome assessment?   For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind outcome assessment. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or class of outcomes. We categorized the methods as:     low risk for outcome assessors;   high risk for outcome assessors; or   unclear risk for outcome assessors.    5. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?   For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re\u2010included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods as:     low risk (< 20% missing data);   high risk (\u2265 20% missing data); or   unclear risk.    6. Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?   For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. For studies in which study protocols were published in advance, we compared prespecified outcomes versus outcomes eventually reported in the published results. If the study protocol was not published in advance, we contacted study authors to gain access to the study protocol. We assessed the methods as:     low risk (where it is clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);    high risk (where not all the study's prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified outcomes of interest and are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or    unclear risk.    7. Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?   For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data\u2010dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:     low risk;   high risk;   unclear risk    If needed, we explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.",
