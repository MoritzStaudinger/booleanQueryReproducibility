    "title": "Sentinel node assessment for diagnosis of groin lymph node involvement in vulval cancer",
    "abstract": "Background Vulval cancer is usually treated by wide local excision with removal of groin lymph nodes (inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy) from one or both sides, depending on the tumour location. However, this procedure is associated with significant morbidity. As lymph node metastasis occurs in about 30% of women with early vulval cancer, accurate prediction of lymph node metastases could reduce the extent of surgery in many women, thereby reducing morbidity. Sentinel node assessment is a diagnostic technique that uses traceable agents to identify the spread of cancer cells to the lymph nodes draining affected tissue. Once the sentinel nodes are identified, they are removed and submitted to histological examination. This technique has been found to be useful in diagnosing the nodal involvement of other types of tumours. Sentinel node assessment in vulval cancer has been evaluated with various tracing agents. It is unclear which tracing agent or combination of agents is most accurate.    Objectives To assess the diagnostic test accuracy of various techniques using traceable agents for sentinel lymph node assessment to diagnose groin lymph node metastasis in women with FIGO stage IB or higher vulval cancer and to investigate sources of heterogeneity.    Search methods We searched MEDLINE (1946 to February 2013), EMBASE (1974 to March 2013) and the relevant Cochrane trial registers.    Selection criteria Studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of traceable agents for sentinel node assessment (involving the identification of a sentinel node plus histological examination) compared with histological examination of removed groin lymph nodes following complete inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL) in women with vulval cancer, provided there were sufficient data for the construction of two\u2010by\u2010two tables.    Data collection and analysis Two authors (TAL, AP) independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance, classified studies for inclusion/exclusion and extracted data. We assessed the methodological quality of studies using the QUADAS\u20102 tool. We used univariate meta\u2010analytical methods to estimate pooled sensitivity estimates.    Main results We included 34 studies evaluating 1614 women and approximately 2396 groins. The overall methodological quality of included studies was moderate. The studies included in this review used the following traceable techniques to identify sentinel nodes in their participants: blue dye only (three studies), technetium only (eight studies), blue dye plus technetium combined (combined tests; 13 studies) and various inconsistent combinations of these three techniques (mixed tests; 10 studies). For studies of mixed tests, we obtained separate test data where possible.  Most studies used haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains for the histological examination. Additionally an immunohistochemical (IHC) stain with and without ultrastaging was employed by 14 and eight studies, respectively. One study used reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis (CA9 RT\u2010PCR), whilst three studies did not describe the histological methods used.  The pooled sensitivity estimate for studies using blue dye only was 0.94 (68 women; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 0.99), for mixed tests was 0.91 (679 women; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.98), for technetium only was 0.93 (149 women; 95% CI 0.89 to 0.96) and for combined tests was 0.95 (390 women; 95% CI 0.89 to 0.97). Negative predictive values (NPVs) for all index tests were > 95%. Most studies also reported sentinel node detection rates (the ability of the test to identify a sentinel node) of the index test. The mean detection rate for blue dye alone was 82%, compared with 95%, 96% and 98% for mixed tests, technetium only and combined tests, respectively. We estimated the clinical consequences of the various tests for 100 women undergoing the sentinel node procedure, assuming the prevalence of groin metastases to be 30%. For the combined or technetium only tests, one and two women with groin metastases might be 'missed', respectively (95% CI 1 to 3); and for mixed tests, three women with groin metastases might be 'missed' (95% CI 1 to 9). The wide CIs associated with the pooled sensitivity estimates for blue dye and mixed tests increased the potential for these tests to 'miss' women with groin metastases.    Authors' conclusions There is little difference in diagnostic test accuracy between the technetium and combined tests. The combined test may reduce the number of women with 'missed' groin node metastases compared with technetium only. Blue dye alone may be associated with more 'missed' cases compared with tests using technetium. Sentinel node assessment with technetium\u2010based tests will reduce the need for IFL by 70% in women with early vulval cancer. It is not yet clear how the survival of women with negative sentinel nodes compares to those undergoing standard surgery (IFL). A randomised controlled trial of sentinel node dissection and IFL has methodological and ethical issues, therefore more observational data on the survival of women with early vulval cancer are needed.",

        "Types of studies": "We included all prospective and retrospective studies that compared and reported diagnostic test accuracy statistics of sentinel node assessment (detection and histological examination) with the reference standard of histological examination of inguinofemoral lymph node dissection (IFL). We included studies that reported the number of sentinel node procedures (each side counted separately; so\u2010called 'per groin' data) and the number of women who underwent a sentinel node procedure (whereby a bilateral sentinel node procedure was reported as one case; so\u2010called 'per woman' data), provided that we could construct two\u2010by\u2010two tables of these data. We excluded studies reporting fewer than 10 sentinel node procedures, as well as studies for which construction of a two\u2010by\u2010two table for either 'per groin' or 'per woman' data was not possible. For studies that included women with clinically suspicious, palpable or metastases\u2010positive groin nodes, we attempted to exclude these women from the extracted data. Where this was not possible, we excluded studies in which these cases exceeded 10% of the total numbers of women or groins assessed.",
        "Participants": "Women diagnosed with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB or higher vulval cancer without clinically suspicious nodes. We considered all ages, histological types of tumour, and all techniques and settings of sentinel node detection, dissection and histological examination in this review.",
        "Index tests": "Tracer agents used to identify sentinel nodes for histological assessment. We expected that trial reports should specify accurately the technique used and include the following: Description of agent   Technique, amount, location and timing of injection of agent   Method used to trace and detect sentinel node   Definition of what was regarded as a sentinel node   Description of the histological method used to assess the sentinel node Description of agent Technique, amount, location and timing of injection of agent Method used to trace and detect sentinel node Definition of what was regarded as a sentinel node Description of the histological method used to assess the sentinel node A sentinel node should have been defined as the first lymph node that showed adequate concentration of tracing agent (e.g. greatest radioactive signal in groin basin detected on hand\u2010held gamma probe in case of radioactive tracer agent, or a node that appeared visually blue intra\u2010operatively) (de Hullu 1998). The sentinel node should then have been removed and subjected to standard histological examination or by frozen section with at least haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. If the sentinel node was found to be malignant, it was defined as a positive sentinel node. If a sentinel node did not show any malignancy, it was defined as a negative sentinel node. If a sentinel node could not be identified, it was defined as 'failure to detect sentinel node' (and not index test negative). Details of reason for failure to detect sentinel nodes should also have been reported where possible, along with the outcome of lymph node status on reference standard. A complete groin lymph node dissection (IFL) would include the sentinel node in the specimen, thus creating a situation where the index test result becomes part of the reference standard (incorporation). Realistically, therefore, false positive tests would not exist in this situation (see Figure 2). In an event where the sentinel node was identified, assessed and deemed histologically positive but the remaining groin nodes were negative, the index test would still be regarded as a true positive. We did not anticipate that false positive tests would be reported in the included studies, but if we encountered them, unless further information was available from the author to create a protocol\u2010compliant two\u2010by\u2010two table, we planned to exclude them from the review. Possible outcomes of sentinel lymph node assessment followed by total groin lymph node removal (inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy). (A) Negative sentinel and rest of the groin nodes (True negative), (B) Positive sentinel node but negative rest of the groin nodes (True positive), (C) Positive sentinel and groin nodes (True positive) and (D) Negative sentinel but positive groin nodes (False negative) We anticipated that many studies would report a combination of various sentinel node assessment techniques (mixed tests). When analysing the diagnostic test accuracy of a single technique, we only included these studies in the analyses if a separate two\u2010by\u2010two table for the technique in question could be constituted. Similarly, not all women received combined techniques (i.e. blue dye and technetium) in these studies. When analysing the diagnostic test accuracy of the combined technique, these studies were only included in the analyses if all cases received the combined technique in question, or a separate two\u2010by\u2010two table for cases who received the combined technique in question could be constituted. Where possible, we attempted to obtain separate diagnostic test accuracy data from investigators of studies in which different index test data had been combined.",
        "Target conditions": "Groin (inguinofemoral) lymph node metastases in FIGO stage IB or higher vulval cancer.",
        "Reference standards": "Histological examination of systematic groin lymph node dissection (IFL) was the reference standard. The reference standard was to be subjected to the standard histological assessment with at least H&E staining. If any of the removed nodes (including the sentinel node) showed cancer metastasis histologically, the reference standard was considered positive. Studies were to report the reference standard result by each side of groin node removal or by women/cases. Systematic groin lymph node removal includes removal of inguinal and femoral lymph nodes. Traditionally this includes removal of lymph nodes above and parallel to the inguinal ligament up to the pubic tubercle medially and lymph nodes from the femoral triangle (parallel to femoral vessels and sapheno\u2010femoral junction including cribriform fascia) up to and including the deep fascia of muscle forming the base of the femoral triangle. Dissection deeper to the deep fascia or into the adductor canal is usually not required. However, there remains some uncertainty regarding the ideal extent and adequacy of surgical dissection (Hudson 2004)."
