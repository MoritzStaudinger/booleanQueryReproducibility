    "title": "Psychological therapies for treatment\u2010resistant depression in adults",
    "abstract": "Background Antidepressants are a first\u2010line treatment for adults with moderate to severe major depression. However, many people prescribed antidepressants for depression don't respond fully to such medication, and little evidence is available to inform the most appropriate 'next step' treatment for such patients, who may be referred to as having treatment\u2010resistant depression (TRD). National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance suggests that the 'next step' for those who do not respond to antidepressants may include a change in the dose or type of antidepressant medication, the addition of another medication, or the start of psychotherapy. Different types of psychotherapies may be used for TRD; evidence on these treatments is available but has not been collated to date.  Along with the sister review of pharmacological therapies for TRD, this review summarises available evidence for the effectiveness of psychotherapies for adults (18 to 74 years) with TRD with the goal of establishing the best 'next step' for this group.    Objectives To assess the effectiveness of psychotherapies for adults with TRD.   Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (until May 2016), along with CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO via OVID (until 16 May 2017). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished and ongoing studies. There were no date or language restrictions.    Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with participants aged 18 to 74 years diagnosed with unipolar depression that had not responded to minimum four weeks of antidepressant treatment at a recommended dose. We excluded studies of drug intolerance. Acceptable diagnoses of unipolar depression were based onthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM\u2010IV\u2010TR) or earlier versions, International Classification of Diseases (ICD)\u201010, Feighner criteria, or Research Diagnostic Criteria. We included the following comparisons.  1. Any psychological therapy versus antidepressant treatment alone, or another psychological therapy.  2. Any psychological therapy given in addition to antidepressant medication versus antidepressant treatment alone, or a psychological therapy alone.  Primary outcomes required were change in depressive symptoms and number of dropouts from study or treatment (as a measure of acceptability).    Data collection and analysis We extracted data, assessed risk of bias in duplicate, and resolved disagreements through discussion or consultation with a third person. We conducted random\u2010effects meta\u2010analyses when appropriate. We summarised continuous outcomes using mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs), and dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RRs).    Main results We included six trials (n = 698; most participants were women approximately 40 years of age). All studies evaluated psychotherapy plus usual care (with antidepressants) versus usual care (with antidepressants). Three studies addressed the addition of cognitive\u2010behavioural therapy (CBT) to usual care (n = 522), and one each evaluated intensive short\u2010term dynamic psychotherapy (ISTDP) (n = 60), interpersonal therapy (IPT) (n = 34), or group dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT) (n = 19) as the intervention. Most studies were small (except one trial of CBT was large), and all studies were at high risk of detection bias for the main outcome of self\u2010reported depressive symptoms.  A random\u2010effects meta\u2010analysis of five trials (n = 575) showed that psychotherapy given in addition to usual care (vs usual care alone) produced improvement in self\u2010reported depressive symptoms (MD \u20104.07 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u20107.07 to \u20101.07 on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scale) over the short term (up to six months). Effects were similar when data from all six studies were combined for self\u2010reported depressive symptoms (SMD \u20100.40, 95% CI \u20100.65 to \u20100.14; n = 635). The quality of this evidence was moderate. Similar moderate\u2010quality evidence of benefit was seen on the Patient Health Questionnaire\u20109 Scale (PHQ\u20109) from two studies (MD \u20104.66, 95% CI 8.72 to \u20100.59; n = 482) and on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) from four studies (MD \u20103.28, 95% CI \u20105.71 to \u20100.85; n = 193).  High\u2010quality evidence shows no differential dropout (a measure of acceptability) between intervention and comparator groups over the short term (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.24; six studies; n = 698).  Moderate\u2010quality evidence for remission from six studies (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.46 to 2.52; n = 635) and low\u2010quality evidence for response from four studies (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.7; n = 556) indicate that psychotherapy was beneficial as an adjunct to usual care over the short term.  With the addition of CBT, low\u2010quality evidence suggests lower depression scores on the BDI scale over the medium term (12 months) (RR \u20103.40, 95% CI \u20107.21 to 0.40; two studies; n = 475) and over the long term (46 months) (RR \u20101.90, 95% CI \u20103.22 to \u20100.58; one study; n = 248). Moderate\u2010quality evidence for adjunctive CBT suggests no difference in acceptability (dropout) over the medium term (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.47; two studies; n = 549) and lower dropout over long term (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.97; one study; n = 248).  Two studies reported serious adverse events (one suicide, two hospitalisations, and two exacerbations of depression) in 4.2% of the total sample, which occurred only in the usual care group (no events in the intervention group).  An economic analysis (conducted as part of an included study) from the UK healthcare perspective (National Health Service (NHS)) revealed that adjunctive CBT was cost\u2010effective over nearly four years.    Authors' conclusions Moderate\u2010quality evidence shows that psychotherapy added to usual care (with antidepressants) is beneficial for depressive symptoms and for response and remission rates over the short term for patients with TRD. Medium\u2010 and long\u2010term effects seem similarly beneficial, although most evidence was derived from a single large trial. Psychotherapy added to usual care seems as acceptable as usual care alone.  Further evidence is needed on the effectiveness of different types of psychotherapies for patients with TRD. No evidence currently shows whether switching to a psychotherapy is more beneficial for this patient group than continuing an antidepressant medication regimen. Addressing this evidence gap is an important goal for researchers.",

We defined treatment resitsant depression as \"A primary diagnosis of unipolar depression that has not responded (or has only partially responded) to a minimum of four weeks of antidepressant treatment at a recommended dose (at least 150 mg/d imipramine or equivalent antidepressant (e.g. 20 mg/d citalopram)).\" We excluded studies that included people who had not responded because of intolerance of antidepressant medication. Although initiatives have sought to improve access to psychological therapies in England and elsewhere, access to psychological treatment remains limited and antidepressants are often given as first\u2010line treatment for adults with depression.

Acceptable diagnoses of unipolar depression include those based on criteria from DSM\u2010IV\u2010TR or earlier versions of this publication (APA 2000), International Classification of Diseases (ICD)\u201010 (WHO 1992), Feighner criteria (Feighner 1972), or Research Diagnostic Criteria (Spitzer 1978). We excluded studies that did not use standardised diagnostic criteria. Excluded from this review are studies of participants with comorbid schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Also excluded are studies including participants with both unipolar and bipolar depression unless data are available for the subgroup of unipolar participants. This review includes studies involving participants with comorbid physical conditions or other psychological disorders (e.g. anxiety) for whom psychological therapy was not being primarily used to manage the physical illness, in other words, the focus of treatment was TRD \u2010 not the comorbidity.",

Response is frequently quantified as at least a 50% reduction in symptoms on HAMD or BDI, but we accepted the study's original definition. Remission is based on the absolute score on the depression measure. Examples of definitions of remission include scores of 7 or less on the HAMD and 10 or less on the BDI.
