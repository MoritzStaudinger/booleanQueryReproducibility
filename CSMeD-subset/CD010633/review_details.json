    "title": "Dopamine transporter imaging for the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies",
    "abstract": "Background Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common cause of neurodegenerative dementia of old age. Its accurate recognition can be important in clinical management and is essential for the development of disease\u2010modifying treatments. The current clinical diagnostic criteria are limited particularly by relatively poor sensitivity. Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging using single\u2010photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is the most highly developed supplementary test for DLB, and is now incorporated as a suggestive feature in the consensus diagnostic criteria. However, there is uncertainty about its accuracy and its place in clinical practice. It is most commonly used in people who are already suspected of having DLB.    Objectives We had two objectives in this review: (A) to estimate the accuracy of DAT imaging for the diagnosis of DLB in people with dementia in secondary care (specialist dementia services), and (B) to estimate the accuracy of DAT imaging for the diagnosis of DLB in people with dementia in secondary care who are already suspected of having DLB on the basis of a prior clinical work\u2010up.    Search methods We searched MEDLINE (1946 to February 2013), Embase (1980 to February 2013), BIOSIS Previews (1926 to February 2013), PsycINFO (1806 to February 2013), CINAHL (1982 to February 2013), LILACS (February 2013) and Web of Science and Conference Proceedings (ISI Web of Science) (1945 to February 2013). Several of these sources contain conference abstracts. We also searched four specialised databases containing diagnostic reviews: Meta\u2010analyses van Diagnostisch Onderzoek (MEDION; February 2013), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE; February 2013), Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA; February 2013), and Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility (ARIF; February 2013). We checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews for potential additional studies. Terms for electronic database searching were devised in conjunction with the team at the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group.    Selection criteria Study design: We included test accuracy studies with delayed verification, diagnostic case\u2010control studies, and two\u2010gate studies with alternative diagnosis controls. Participants: (A) participants with dementia in secondary care, (B) participants in secondary care meeting consensus clinical criteria (other than the DAT imaging criterion) for possible or probable DLB, or both. Index test: SPECT or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of brain dopamine transporters. Reference standard: Neuropathological diagnosis at autopsy.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. We extracted results into a 2x2 table, showing the binary test results cross\u2010classified with the binary reference standard. We used this data to calculate sensitivities, specificities, and their 95% confidence intervals. We used the QUADAS\u20102 tool plus some additional items to assess methodological quality.    Main results We included one study that was applicable to our first objective (A). It reported data on 22 participants who met consensus clinical criteria for DLB or National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS\u2010ADRDA) criteria for Alzheimer's disease, or both (a two\u2010gate design with alternative diagnosis controls). The index test was SPECT scanning using the ligand 123I\u2010FP\u2010CIT. We considered the study to be at high risk of bias in the participant selection and index test domains (QUADAS\u20102). 123I\u2010FP\u2010CIT SPECT analysed semiquantitatively had a sensitivity of 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.00) and a specificity of 0.92 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.00) for the diagnosis of DLB (n = 22, 1 study). Analysed visually, the sensitivity was 0.86 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.00) and the specificity was 0.83 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.98) (n = 19, 1 study).  We considered that the study also provided the best available data to address our second objective (B). At baseline, 15 participants were clinically suspected of having DLB. In this group, 123I\u2010FP\u2010CIT SPECT scanning analysed semiquantitatively had a sensitivity of 1.00 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.00) and a specificity of 1.00 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.00) for the diagnosis of DLB (n = 15, 1 study). Analysed visually, accuracy in this group was lower with a sensitivity of 0.83 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.00) and a specificity of 0.71 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.96) (n = 13, 1 study).    Authors' conclusions Only one study has used a neuropathological reference standard to assess the accuracy of DAT imaging for the diagnosis of DLB. The small size of the included study means that sensitivity and specificity estimates are imprecise. However, data from this study suggest that DAT imaging is more accurate than clinical diagnosis. Clinical diagnosis is therefore unsuitable to use as a reference standard for assessing the accuracy of DAT imaging.  No studies using a neuropathological reference standard have directly addressed the common clinical scenario where the use of DAT imaging is considered as a diagnostic test in a person with possible DLB, or assessed the accuracy of DAT imaging in people with mild dementia. However, the data from the included study suggest that, where there is moderately severe dementia and a strong pre\u2010existing suspicion of DLB (probable DLB), then a normal (123)I\u2010FP\u2010CIT SPECT scan may be an accurate means of excluding the diagnosis.  Semiquantitative ratings of 123I\u2010FP\u2010CIT SPECT scans appeared to be more accurate than visual ratings in all analyses.",

        "Types of studies": "(a) Test accuracy studies with delayed verification. (b) Diagnostic case\u2010control studies. This applied to objective A only. These may be true case\u2010control studies, conducted retrospectively, in which participants who underwent DAT imaging in life are included on the basis of the presence or absence of a neuropathological diagnosis of DLB at autopsy. We anticipated that a more common design would be studies in which participants were selected for inclusion on the basis of their clinically defined DLB diagnostic status. 'Cases' would meet clinical criteria (excluding the DAT imaging criterion) for probable DLB; 'controls' would not meet these criteria but would meet clinical criteria for one or more other subtypes of dementia. There is no universally agreed term for these studies, but they have been called 'two\u2010gate designs with alternative diagnosis controls' (Rutjes 2005). These study designs were eligible for inclusion but would, if possible, be the subject of sensitivity analysis because of the risk of spectrum bias they entail.",
        "Participants": "Objective A: Participants with dementia in secondary care settings. Dementia should have been diagnosed using validated clinical criteria (for example ICD, DSM). Studies that specifically excluded subjects meeting criteria for dementias other than DLB or AD (for example vascular dementia) could also be included. Objective B: Participants meeting clinical criteria (other than the DAT imaging criterion) for possible or probable DLB, or both. We considered this to be the most useful test of utility in clinical practice, where DAT imaging is likely to be used in addition to clinical assessment. A population meeting clinical criteria for probable DLB will already have missed many true DLB cases (because of the relatively poor sensitivity), and the opportunity for adding diagnostic value is limited (because of the already high specificity). Hence, the potential clinical utility of the test is greatest if applied to a population meeting the more sensitive but less specific criteria for possible DLB. However, participants meeting probable DLB criteria could also be included; we would examine this as a potential source of heterogeneity. We excluded participants with Parkinson's disease or other Parkinsonian syndromes known to be associated with abnormal DAT imaging.",

        "Reference standards": "Neuropathological diagnosis at autopsy using contemporaneously accepted neuropathological criteria. We did not include in this review any studies in which a clinical diagnosis of probable DLB was the reference standard. There were two reasons for this: 1. Firstly, as discussed above, the accuracy\u2015particularly the sensitivity\u2015of the clinical criteria measured against the neuropathological reference standard is too low for them to constitute a satisfactory proxy. There is a serious possibility that the index test might outperform clinical diagnosis, rendering the latter unsuitable as a reference standard (Reitsma 2009). For some conditions, the correct clinical diagnosis may become more evident over time so that clinical diagnosis at follow\u2010up may be a better reference standard than the cross\u2010sectional diagnosis. (It has been used, for example, in studies of DAT imaging in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.) However, this strategy is not necessarily suitable for DLB where, as the condition progresses, symptoms converge with other types of dementia. Beyond a certain (undetermined) point, therefore, clinical diagnosis may become less discriminating with time. 2. Secondly, due to their complexity and expense, SPECT scans will probably only ever be useful as an adjunct to clinical assessment. Studies that by design cannot demonstrate an accuracy above that of careful clinical diagnosis alone have limited usefulness. A difficulty with a neuropathological reference standard (common to all diagnostic studies with delayed verification designs) is that the pathology may change between application of the index test and reference standard. In this context, the most likely scenario is that AD pathology may develop in the interim, reducing the likelihood that the initial clinical syndrome will be correctly classified as due to DLB. This may lead to a systematic bias, underestimating the specificity of the index test."

The term Parkinson's disease dementia should be used to describe dementia that occurs in the context of well\u2010established Parkinson's disease. In a practice setting the term that is most appropriate to the clinical situation should be used; generic terms such as Lewy body disease are often helpful. In research studies in which a distinction needs to be made between DLB and Parkinson's disease dementia, the existing 1\u2010year rule between the onset of dementia and parkinsonism DLB continues to be recommended. Adoption of other time periods will simply confound data pooling or comparison between studies. In other research settings that may include clinicopathologic studies and clinical trials, both clinical phenotypes may be considered collectively under categories such as Lewy body disease or alpha\u2010synucleinopathy.",
