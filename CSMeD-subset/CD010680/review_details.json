    "title": "Ankle brachial index for the diagnosis of lower limb peripheral arterial disease",
    "abstract": "Background Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower limb is common, with prevalence of both symptomatic and asymptomatic disease estimated at 13% in the over 50 age group. Symptomatic PAD affects about 5% of individuals in Western populations between the ages of 55 and 74 years. The most common initial symptom of PAD is muscle pain on exercise that is relieved by rest and is attributed to reduced lower limb blood flow due to atherosclerotic disease (intermittent claudication). The ankle brachial index (ABI) is widely used by a variety of healthcare professionals, including specialist nurses, physicians, surgeons and podiatrists working in primary and secondary care settings, to assess signs and symptoms of PAD. As the ABI test is non\u2010invasive and inexpensive and is in widespread clinical use, a systematic review of its diagnostic accuracy in people presenting with leg pain suggestive of PAD is highly relevant to routine clinical practice.    Objectives To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of the ankle brachial index (ABI) \u2010 also known as the ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) \u2010 for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease in people who experience leg pain on walking that is alleviated by rest.    Search methods We carried out searches of the following databases in August 2013: MEDLINE (Ovid SP),Embase (Ovid SP), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (EBSCO), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences (LILACS) (Bireme), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and the Health Technology Assessment Database in The Cochrane Library, the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Conference Proceedings Citation Index \u2010 Science, the British Library Zetoc Conference search and Medion.    Selection criteria We included cross\u2010sectional studies of ABI in which duplex ultrasonography or angiography was used as the reference standard. We also included cross\u2010sectional or diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) cohort studies consisting of both prospective and retrospective studies.  Participants were adults presenting with leg pain on walking that was relieved by rest, who were tested in primary care settings or secondary care settings (hospital outpatients only) and who did not have signs or symptoms of critical limb ischaemia (rest pain, ischaemic ulcers or gangrene).  The index test was ABI, also called the ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) or the Ankle Arm Index (AAI), which was performed with a hand\u2010held doppler or oscillometry device to detect ankle vessels. We included data collected via sphygmomanometers (both manual and aneroid) and digital equipment.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently replicated data extraction by using a standard form, which included an assessment of study quality, and resolved disagreements by discussion. Two review authors extracted participant\u2010level data when available to populate 2\u00d72 contingency tables (true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives).  After a pilot phase involving two review authors working independently, we used the methodological quality assessment tool the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies\u20102 (QUADAS\u20102), which incorporated our review question \u2010 along with a flow diagram to aid reviewers' understanding of the conduct of the study when necessary and an assessment of risk of bias and applicability judgements.    Main results We screened 17,055 records identified through searches of databases. We obtained 746 full\u2010text articles and assessed them for relevance. We scrutinised 49 studies to establish their eligibility for inclusion in the review and excluded 48, primarily because participants were not patients presenting solely with exertional leg pain, investigators used no reference standard or investigators used neither angiography nor duplex ultrasonography as the reference standard. We excluded most studies for more than one reason.  Only one study met the eligibility criteria and provided limb\u2010level accuracy data from just 85 participants (158 legs). This prospective study compared the manual doppler method of obtaining an ABI (performed by untrained personnel) with the automated oscillometric method. Limb\u2010level data, as reported by the study, indicated that the accuracy of the ABI in detecting significant arterial disease on angiography is superior when stenosis is present in the femoropopliteal vessels, with sensitivity of 97% (95% confidence interval (CI) 93% to 99%) and specificity of 89% (95% CI 67% to 95%) for oscillometric ABI, and sensitivity of 95% (95% CI 89% to 97%) and specificity of 56% (95% CI 33% to 70%) for doppler ABI. The ABI threshold was not reported. Investigators attributed the lower specificity for doppler to the fact that a tibial or dorsalis pedis pulse could not be detected by doppler in 12 of 27 legs with normal vessels or non\u2010significant lesions. The superiority of the oscillometric (automated) method for obtaining an ABI reading over the manual method with a doppler probe used by inexperienced operators may be a clinically important finding.    Authors' conclusions Evidence about the accuracy of the ankle brachial index for the diagnosis of PAD in people with leg pain on exercise that is alleviated by rest is sparse. The single study included in our review provided only limb\u2010level data from a few participants. Well\u2010designed cross\u2010sectional studies are required to evaluate the accuracy of ABI in patients presenting with early symptoms of peripheral arterial disease in all healthcare settings. Another systematic review of existing studies assessing the use of ABI in alternative patient groups, including asymptomatic, high\u2010risk patients, is required.",

        "Types of studies": "We included studies of ABI that used duplex ultrasonography or angiography as the reference standard. We included cross\u2010sectional or diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) cohort studies examining both prospective and retrospective studies. These studies had to report that all participants received a reference standard; investigators had to present cross\u2010tabulated results of the index test and the reference standard (2\u00d72 table), or had to report sufficient information to allow the 2\u00d72 table data to be back\u2010calculated.",
        "Participants": "Adults with leg pain on walking relieved by rest, who are tested in primary care settings or secondary care settings (hospital outpatients only) and do not have signs or symptoms of critical limb ischaemia (rest pain, ischaemic ulcers or gangrene). We excluded from the review patients who were free of exertional leg pain, as well as those with CLI.",
        "Index tests": "Ankle brachial index (ABI), also called ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI).

Risk of bias   Describe the methods of patient selection given in the report:     SQ 1: Was a consecutive or random sample of patients enrolled?   Yes: it is reported that a consecutive or a random sample was included  Unclear: the precise method of sampling is not reported      SQ 2: Did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions?   Yes: the study included all symptomatic outpatients (in primary or secondary care) without previous ABI test results  No: the study included patients who had received an ABI test before, or were asymptomatic  Unclear: the ABI test history of the patients in the study was not reported      B. Concerns regarding applicability   Give the paper's description of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, including setting, prior tests and symptoms      Domain 2: Index test    \u00a0     A. Risk of bias   Give the paper's description of the index test and how it was conducted and interpreted, including the background of the person who carried out the test      SQ 1: Were index test results interpreted without knowledge of results of the reference standard?    Yes: it is stated that the index tests were interpreted in a blind manner (i.e. without knowledge of results of the reference standard), or the index test was always performed and interpreted before the reference standard  No: the results of the reference standard were known to the reader of the index test  Unclear: it is not reported whether the index test was conducted without knowledge of results of the index test, or whether the index test was completed before the reference standard      SQ 2: If a threshold was used, was it prespecified?   Yes: value for an abnormal test result is < 0.90, and this is clearly stated in the Methods section or elsewhere in the report  No: values for a normal or abnormal test results are not reported (prespecified)  Unclear: it is not clear at what point in time values for normal and abnormal test results were decided      SQ 3: Was the person conducting the test (measuring the ABI) trained to do so?   Yes: it is stated that the person conducting the test was trained in ABI measurement  No: it is clearly reported that the person conducting the test was not trained in ABI measurement  Unclear: the expertise and background of the individuals conducting the index test are unclear      B. Concerns regarding applicability?   High: the index test was conducted using hand\u2010held Dopplers as opposed to a stethoscope or other equipment not widely available  Low: the index test was not conducted using hand\u2010held Dopplers, and the equipment was standard (as outlined in the protocol)  Unclear: information about the equipment used to conduct the test is not presented      Domain 3: Reference standard    \u00a0     A. Risk of bias   Give the reported definition of the reference standard and how it was conducted and interpreted      SQ 1: Is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition?   Yes: it is reported that duplex ultrasonography or angiography test results were interpreted by trained operatives  No: it is reported that the duplex ultrasonography or angiography test results were not interpreted by trained operatives  Unclear: it is not clear whether those individuals who interpreted the duplex ultrasonography or angiography test results were trained      SQ 2: Were the reference standard test results interpreted without knowledge of the index test results?    Yes: the person classifying the reference standard test results was unaware of the ABI test results  No: the person classifying the reference standard test results was aware of the ABI test results  Unclear: not reported      SQ 3: Was the person conducting the reference standard test (duplex ultrasonography) trained?   Yes: it is stated that the person conducting the reference standard test was trained in the interpretation of duplex ultrasonography No: it is clear that the person conducting the reference standard test was not trained in the interpretation of duplex ultrasonography  Unclear: the expertise and background of the reference standard test readers are unclear      Domain 4: Flow and timing    \u00a0     A. Risk of bias   Describe the reasons why any patients recruited into the study did not contribute to the 2 \u00d7 2 table (i.e. patients who did not undergo the reference standard and/or the index test) referring to the flow diagram  Give the time interval between the ABI and the reference standard tests     SQ 1: Was there an appropriate interval between the index test and the reference standard?   Yes: the index and reference standard tests were all conducted within 2 weeks of each other  No: some of the reference standard test results were not conducted within 2 weeks of each other  Unclear: no information about the relative timing of the tests is provided      SQ 2: Did all the patients receive the same reference standard?   Yes: a complete set of reference standard test results is available for all study patients  No: the same reference standard test results are not available for all patients  Unclear: insufficient information is available to make a judgement about the availability of reference standard      SQ 3: Were all patients included in the final analysis?   Yes: all patients enrolled contributed to the 2 \u00d7 2 table  No: not all patients enrolled contributed to the 2 \u00d7 2 table  Unclear: it is not clear whether patients were recruited but not included in the study report of the 2 \u00d7 2 table"
