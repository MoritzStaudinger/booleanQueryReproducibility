    "title": "Lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan assay for detecting active tuberculosis in people living with HIV",
    "abstract": "Background The lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan (LF\u2010LAM) assay Alere Determine\u2122 TB LAM Ag is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to help detect active tuberculosis in HIV\u2010positive people with severe HIV disease. This review update asks the question, \"does new evidence justify the use of LF\u2010LAM in a broader group of people?\u201d, and is part of the WHO process for updating guidance on the use of LF\u2010LAM.    Objectives To assess the accuracy of LF\u2010LAM for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis among HIV\u2010positive adults with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis (symptomatic participants) and among HIV\u2010positive adults irrespective of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis (unselected participants not assessed for tuberculosis signs and symptoms).  The proposed role for LF\u2010LAM is as an add on to clinical judgement and with other tests to assist in diagnosing tuberculosis.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, Web of Science, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Scopus, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry, and ProQuest, without language restriction to 11 May 2018.    Selection criteria Randomized trials, cross\u2010sectional, and observational cohort studies that evaluated LF\u2010LAM for active tuberculosis (pulmonary and extrapulmonary) in HIV\u2010positive adults. We included studies that used the manufacturer's recommended threshold for test positivity, either the updated reference card with four bands (grade 1 of 4) or the corresponding prior reference card grade with five bands (grade 2 of 5). The reference standard was culture or nucleic acid amplification test from any body site (microbiological). We considered a higher quality reference standard to be one in which two or more specimen types were evaluated for tuberculosis diagnosis and a lower quality reference standard to be one in which only one specimen type was evaluated.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form and REDCap electronic data capture tools. We appraised the quality of studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies\u20102 (QUADAS\u20102) tool and performed meta\u2010analyses to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity using a bivariate random\u2010effects model and a Bayesian approach. We analyzed studies enrolling strictly symptomatic participants separately from those enrolling unselected participants. We investigated pre\u2010defined sources of heterogeneity including the influence of CD4 count and clinical setting on the accuracy estimates. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.    Main results We included 15 unique studies (nine new studies and six studies from the original review that met the inclusion criteria): eight studies among symptomatic adults and seven studies among unselected adults. All studies were conducted in low\u2010 or middle\u2010income countries. Risk of bias was high in the patient selection and reference standard domains, mainly because studies excluded participants unable to produce sputum and used a lower quality reference standard.  Participants with tuberculosis symptoms   LF\u2010LAM pooled sensitivity (95% credible interval (CrI) ) was 42% (31% to 55%) (moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and pooled specificity was 91% (85% to 95%) (very low\u2010certainty evidence), (8 studies, 3449 participants, 37% with tuberculosis).  For a population of 1000 people where 300 have microbiologically\u2010confirmed tuberculosis, the utilization of LF\u2010LAM would result in: 189 to be LF\u2010LAM positive: of these, 63 (33%) would not have tuberculosis (false\u2010positives); and 811 to be LF\u2010LAM negative: of these, 174 (21%) would have tuberculosis (false\u2010negatives).  By clinical setting, pooled sensitivity was 52% (40% to 64%) among inpatients versus 29% (17% to 47%) among outpatients; and pooled specificity was 87% (78% to 93%) among inpatients versus 96% (91% to 99%) among outpatients. Stratified by CD4 cell count, pooled sensitivity increased, and specificity decreased with lower CD4 cell count.  Unselected participants not assessed for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis   LF\u2010LAM pooled sensitivity was 35% (22% to 50%), (moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and pooled specificity was 95% (89% to 96%), (low\u2010certainty evidence), (7 studies, 3365 participants, 13% with tuberculosis).  For a population of 1000 people where 100 have microbiologically\u2010confirmed tuberculosis, the utilization of LF\u2010LAM would result in: 80 to be LF\u2010LAM positive: of these, 45 (56%) would not have tuberculosis (false\u2010positives); and 920 to be LF\u2010LAM negative: of these, 65 (7%) would have tuberculosis (false\u2010negatives).  By clinical setting, pooled sensitivity was 62% (41% to 83%) among inpatients versus 31% (18% to 47%) among outpatients; pooled specificity was 84% (48% to 96%) among inpatients versus 95% (87% to 99%) among outpatients. Stratified by CD4 cell count, pooled sensitivity increased, and specificity decreased with lower CD4 cell count.    Authors' conclusions We found that LF\u2010LAM has a sensitivity of 42% to diagnose tuberculosis in HIV\u2010positive individuals with tuberculosis symptoms and 35% in HIV\u2010positive individuals not assessed for tuberculosis symptoms, consistent with findings reported previously. Regardless of how people are enrolled, sensitivity is higher in inpatients and those with lower CD4 cell, but a concomitant lower specificity. As a simple point\u2010of\u2010care test that does not depend upon sputum evaluation, LF\u2010LAM may assist with the diagnosis of tuberculosis, particularly when a sputum specimen cannot be produced.",

        "Types of studies": "We included primary studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of urine LF\u2010LAM assay for the detection of active tuberculosis in people living with HIV and compared the index test results with a defined microbiological reference standard. We included studies from which we could extract true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN) values.  Diagnostic studies for tuberculosis are largely cross\u2010sectional in design, but may include some clinical follow\u2010up as part of patient classification. We included cross\u2010sectional studies and observational cohort studies. In addition, we included randomized controlled trials that evaluated the use of the index test on patient health outcomes, but that also reported sensitivity and specificity. Although the study design was a randomized trial for the purpose of determining the impact of the test on participant outcomes, the study design was a cross\u2010sectional study for the purpose of determining the diagnostic accuracy of the index test in this review. We excluded case\u2010control studies and other study designs. We excluded data reported only in abstracts, reviews, comments, and editorial notes. We did not include unpublished studies.",
        "Participants": "People living with HIV are at increased risk of tuberculosis and may present with symptoms of tuberculosis but may also be asymptomatic or have symptoms not routinely associated with tuberculosis. We included participants who were adults (15 years and older is considered \u2018adult' for purpose of tuberculosis surveillance) and HIV positive. We included studies in which there was a suspicion of tuberculosis among study participants based on the presence of signs and symptoms compatible with tuberculosis (studies with symptomatic participants), as well as studies that included participants who presented for medical care irrespective of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis (studies with unselected participants). Signs and symptoms of tuberculosis include cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats. Participants who were known to have active tuberculosis and were taking anti\u2010tuberculosis drugs were not included.",
        "Index tests": "We included studies that evaluated the lateral flow lipoarabinomannan (LF\u2010LAM) assay Alere Determine\u2122 TB LAM Ag test (Abbott, Palatine, IL, USA, previous Alere Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) on urine samples. As of May 2019, the Alere Determine\u2122 TB LAM Ag test was the only commercially available LF\u2010LAM assay that had been evaluated in published studies. We included studies that evaluated the test at the manufacturer's recommended threshold for positivity, i.e. grade 1 and above on the updated reference scale card with four band intensities graded on a scale of 1 to 4. For studies that used the prior reference scale card with band intensities graded on a scale of 1 to 5, we included those that evaluated the test at grade 2 and above corresponding to the current recommended positivity threshold. We excluded studies that did not use a positivity threshold corresponding to the manufacturer's recommendations. Results summarizing diagnostic accuracy at older thresholds (grade 1 on a scale of 1 to 5) can be found in the original review (Shah 2016).",
        "Target conditions": "The target condition was active tuberculosis, which includes pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis.",
        "Reference standards": "We required studies to diagnose tuberculosis using the following microbiological reference standard. \u2018Tuberculosis' is defined as a positive M tuberculosis culture or NAAT.    \u2018Not tuberculosis' is defined as a negative M tuberculosis culture and NAAT (if performed). \u2018Tuberculosis' is defined as a positive M tuberculosis culture or NAAT. \u2018Not tuberculosis' is defined as a negative M tuberculosis culture and NAAT (if performed). NAAT tests included: Enhanced Amplified Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct Test (E\u2010MTD, Gen\u2010Probe, San Diego, USA); Amplicor Mycobacterium tuberculosis Test (Amplicor, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland); COBAS\u00ae TaqMan\u00ae MTB Test (Roche Diagnostics); GenoType MTBDRplus (HAIN Lifesciences, Nehren, Germany); Xpert\u00ae MTB/RIF assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, USA); and Xpert\u00ae MTB/RIF Ultra. We considered a higher quality reference standard to be one in which two or more specimen types were evaluated for tuberculosis diagnosis in all participants as part of a standardized study algorithm. We considered a lower quality reference standard to be one in which only one specimen type was evaluated for tuberculosis diagnosis, or if there was no algorithm defined to ensure a standardized approach for specimen collection and testing. A microbiological reference standard, primarily culture, is considered the best reference standard. We expected all studies to obtain sputum specimens and some studies to obtain additional specimens for culture. However, the primary concern with relying on sputum culture alone is that tuberculosis diagnosis may be missed for the following reasons: people living with HIV may not be able to provide sputum specimens of sufficient quality; sputum bacillary load is typically low in people living with HIV; and a substantial proportion of people with HIV\u2010associated tuberculosis cannot produce sputum at all (Lawn 2013), or have extrapulmonary tuberculosis without pulmonary tuberculosis. This means that index test TPs may be misclassified as FPs by sputum culture. Therefore, when evaluating LF\u2010LAM with respect to sputum culture, the number of FPs (classified as positive by the index test and negative by the reference test) may be increased and LF\u2010LAM specificity may be underestimated (Lawn 2015). This misclassification may also lead to underestimation of sensitivity. Increasing the sensitivity of the reference standard by evaluating multiple specimens, including evaluating specimens from sites of disease for extrapulmonary tuberculosis, may reduce the number of cases of tuberculosis incorrectly classified as \u2018not tuberculosis' by culture or NAAT if performed. In the original Cochrane Review, we additionally considered a \u2018composite microbiological and clinical reference standard\u2019 recognizing that microbiological reference standards alone may fail to detect tuberculosis in patients with tuberculosis. However, our original review found relatively little data using a composite reference standard; found heterogeneity in defining and applying composite reference standards; and found a relatively modest impact on pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity comparing microbiological and composite reference standards. Results assessing diagnostic accuracy against a composite reference standard can be found in the original review (Shah 2016). Given the limitations of the reference standard, we might have considered pursuing latent class analysis (Chu 2009; Kohli 2018). However, we lacked patient\u2010level data on the type of specimen and LAM is not site\u2010specific, meaning a positive LAM alone does not tell us whether the patient has pulmonary or extrapulmonary tuberculosis."

        "Appendix 6. QUADAS\u20102": "Domain 1: patient selection  Risk of bias: could the selection of patients have introduced bias?  Signaling question 1: Was a consecutive or random sample of patients enrolled? We answered \u2018yes' if the study enrolled a consecutive or random sample of eligible participants; \u2018no' if the study selected participants by convenience; and \u2018unclear' if the study did not report the manner of participant selection or we could not tell.    Signaling question 2: Was a case\u2010control design avoided? We answered \u2018yes' to all included studies given that we are excluding case\u2010control study designs.    Signaling question 3: Did the study avoid inappropriate exclusion? We answered \u2018yes' to studies which included all HIV\u2010positive participants and participants who were unable to produce sputum (expectorated or induced). We answered \u2018no' if studies excluded participants who could not produce sputum (i.e. there were no attempts at sputum induction or patients could not produce sputum despite sputum induction and were excluded). We also answered \u2018no' if studies excluded patients presumed to have extrapulmonary tuberculosis. We scored \u2018unclear' if we could not tell.    Applicability: Are there concerns that the included patients and setting do not match the review question?  We were interested in how LF\u2010LAM performs in patients whose urine specimens were evaluated as they would be in routine practice. We expected to judge \u2018low concern\u2019 for most studies since we planned to determine test accuracy both for patients with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis and patients investigated for tuberculosis irrespective of signs and symptoms for tuberculosis.  For LF\u2010LAM used as a tuberculosis diagnostic test among patients with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, we judged \u2018high concern' if the study participants did not resemble people with presumed HIV/tuberculosis; \u2018low concern' if the study population did resemble a population with presumed HIV/tuberculosis, and \u2018unclear concern', if we could not tell.  For LF\u2010LAM used as a tuberculosis diagnostic test among patients that were investigated for tuberculosis irrespective of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, we judged \u2018low concern' for studies in which the LF\u2010LAM was performed uniformly within the predetermined study target populations of HIV\u2010infected individuals, \u2018high concern' if LF\u2010LAM was not performed uniformly within the predetermined study target populations of HIV\u2010infected individuals, and \u2018unclear concern' if we could not tell. We judged \u2018high concern' if the study participants did not resemble people with presumed HIV/tuberculosis coinfection.      Domain 2: index test  Risk of bias: could the conduct or interpretation of the index test have introduced bias?   Signaling question 1: were the index test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard?  We answered \u2018yes' if the study interpreted the result of LF\u2010LAM blinded to the result of the reference standard; we answered \u2018no' if the study did not interpret the result of LF\u2010LAM blinded to the result of the reference standard. We answered \u2018yes' for studies in which LF\u2010LAM was performed on fresh specimens, since reference standard results would be unavailable at the time of test interpretation. We answered \u2018unclear' if stored specimens were tested and we could not tell if the index test results were interpreted without knowledge of the reference standard results.    Signaling question 2: if a LF\u2010LAM threshold was used to define positivity, was it prespecified?  We answered \u2018yes' if the threshold was prespecified in the study or by the authors, \u2018no' if the threshold was not prespecified, and \u2018unclear' if we could not determine if the threshold was prespecified or not.    Applicability: are there concerns that the index test, its conduct, or its interpretation differ from the review question?  If index test methods vary from those specified in the review question, concerns about applicability may exist. We judged \u2018high concern' if the test procedure was inconsistent with the manufacturer recommendations, \u2018low concern' if the test procedure was consistent with the manufacturer recommendations, and \u2018unclear concern' if we could not tell. In cases where the primary study defined grade 1 of 5 as the positivity threshold, but where we were able to extract data at the manufacturer\u2019s currently recommended positivity threshold, we judged \u2018low concern\u2019 for applicability.      Domain 3: reference standard  Risk of bias: could the reference standard, its conduct, or its interpretation have introduced bias?   Signaling question 1: is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition?  HIV\u2010infected tuberculosis patients may have pulmonary tuberculosis, extrapulmonary tuberculosis, or both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis. A microbiological reference standard, primarily culture, is considered the gold standard for tuberculosis. Owing to the difficulties in diagnosing HIV\u2010associated tuberculosis, it is recommended that multiple cultures from sputum and other specimens be evaluated.  We answered \u2018yes' when appropriate specimens were obtained for the diagnosis of HIV\u2010associated tuberculosis. For presumed pulmonary tuberculosis, sputum specimens should be obtained for culture, NAAT, or both culture and NAAT. If the patient cannot produce sputum, induced sputum should be performed. For presumed extrapulmonary tuberculosis, specimens should be consistent with Standard 4 of the International Standards for Tuberculosis Care which states: \"For all patients, including children, suspected of having extrapulmonary tuberculosis, appropriate specimens from the suspected sites of involvement should be obtained for microbiological and histological examination\" (TB CARE I 2014). We answered yes if multiple specimens were collected from different sites for extrapulmonary tuberculosis. An Xpert\u00ae MTB/RIF test is recommended as the preferred initial microbiological test for suspected tuberculosis meningitis because of the need for a rapid diagnosis\". We also answered \u2018yes' if studies followed a standardized approach of collecting appropriate specimens from \"suspected sites of involvement\", for example, blood or lymph nodes on all patients.  We answered \u2018no' when the reference standard was restricted to sputum specimens or the reference standard was restricted to extrapulmonary specimens (for example, urine, blood, etc.). We also answered \u2018no' if a consistent approach was not followed for all patients (for example, some but not all patients with presumed tuberculosis lymphadenitis receive lymph node tissue sampling). We answered \u2018unclear' if we could not tell.    Signaling question 2: were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index test?  We answered \u2018yes' if the study interpreted the result of the reference standard blinded to the result of LF\u2010LAM, or if the reference standard result was reported on an automated instrument; \u2018no' if the study did not interpret the result of the reference standard blinded to the result of LF\u2010LAM, and \u2018unclear' if we could not tell.    Applicability: are there concerns that the target condition as defined by the reference standard does not match the question?  In general, we thought there was low concern for almost included studies based on the current definitions of the reference standard. We judged \u2018high concern' if included studies did not speciate mycobacteria isolated in culture, \u2018low concern' if speciation was performed, and \u2018unclear' if we could not tell. We also judged high concern if there was no protocol to ensure a minimum standard of testing with a reference standard.      Domain 4: Flow and timing  Risk of bias: could the patient flow have introduced bias?  Signaling question 1: was there an appropriate interval between the index test and reference standard?  We expected urine specimens for LF\u2010LAM and the reference standards to be obtained at the same time and answered \u2018yes' for all studies that meet this criterion, or if index and reference standard tests were performed on specimens collected no greater than seven days apart. We chose seven days as a time period during which either treatment of tuberculosis or natural progression of tuberculosis without treatment could impact test results. We answered \u2018no' if specimens were collected for index and reference standard tests greater than seven days apart, and \u2018unclear' if we could not tell.    Signaling question 2: did all patients receive the same reference standard? We answered \u2018yes' if all participants in the study received the reference standard to confirm tuberculosis; \u2018no' if not all patients received the reference standard to confirm tuberculosis, and \u2018unclear' if we could not tell.    Signaling question 3: were all patients included in the analysis? We determined the answer to this question by comparing the number of participants enrolled in the study with the number of participants included in the two\u2010by\u2010two tables. We answered \u2018yes' if all participants enrolled in the study were tested with results presented and accounted for. We answered \u2018no' if participants meeting enrolment criteria were not tested or results were not presented, and \u2018unclear' if we could not tell.    Judgements for \u02bdRisk of bias' assessments: If we answered all signalling questions for a domain \"yes\", then we judged risk of bias as \"low\". If we answered all or most signalling questions for a domain \"no\", then we judged risk of bias as \"high\". If we answered only one signalling question for a domain \"no\", we discussed further the \"risk of bias\" judgement. If we answered all or most signalling questions for a domain \"unclear\", then we judged risk of bias as \"unclear\". If we answered only one signalling question for a domain \"unclear\", we discussed further the \"risk of bias\" judgement for the domain.",

In the subsections below, we first describe the likelihood and prior distribution for the model followed by the OpenBUGS program.  As is usual with Bayesian models, initial values must be provided for all unknown parameters. We selected three independent sets of initial values for the parameters using the in\u2010built ModelGenInits() function within OpenBUGS. The Gelman\u2010Rubin statistic within the OpenBUGS program was used to assess convergence. We did not observe any convergence problems for the analyses presented. We treated the first 10,000 iterations as burn\u2010in iterations and dropped them. We obtained summary statistics based on a total of 150,000 iterations resulting from the three separate chains.
