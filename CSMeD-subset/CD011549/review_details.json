    "title": "Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones",
    "abstract": "Background Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) are tests used in the diagnosis of common bile duct stones in patients suspected of having common bile duct stones prior to undergoing invasive treatment. There has been no systematic review of the accuracy of EUS and MRCP in the diagnosis of common bile duct stones using appropriate reference standards.    Objectives To determine and compare the accuracy of EUS and MRCP for the diagnosis of common bile duct stones.    Search methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, BIOSIS, and Clinicaltrials.gov until September 2012. We searched the references of included studies to identify further studies and of systematic reviews identified from various databases (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment (HTA), Medion, and ARIF (Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility)). We did not restrict studies based on language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively.    Selection criteria We included studies that provided the number of true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives for EUS or MRCP. We only accepted studies that confirmed the presence of common bile duct stones by extraction of the stones (irrespective of whether this was done by surgical or endoscopic methods) for a positive test, and absence of common bile duct stones by surgical or endoscopic negative exploration of the common bile duct or symptom free follow\u2010up for at least six months for a negative test, as the reference standard in people suspected of having common bile duct stones. We included participants with or without prior diagnosis of cholelithiasis; with or without symptoms and complications of common bile duct stones, with or without prior treatment for common bile duct stones; and before or after cholecystectomy. At least two authors independently screened abstracts and selected studies for inclusion.    Data collection and analysis Two authors independently collected the data from each study. We used the bivariate model to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity.    Main results We included a total of 18 studies involving 2366 participants (976 participants with common bile duct stones and 1390 participants without common bile duct stones). Eleven studies evaluated EUS alone, and five studies evaluated MRCP alone. Two studies evaluated both tests. Most studies included patients who were suspected of having common bile duct stones based on abnormal liver function tests; abnormal transabdominal ultrasound; symptoms such as obstructive jaundice, cholangitis, or pancreatitis; or a combination of the above. The proportion of participants who had undergone cholecystectomy varied across studies. Not one of the studies was of high methodological quality. For EUS, the sensitivities ranged between 0.75 and 1.00 and the specificities ranged between 0.85 and 1.00. The summary sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI)) and specificity (95% CI) of the 13 studies that evaluated EUS (1537 participants; 686 cases and 851 participants without common bile duct stones) were 0.95 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.97) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.94 to 0.99). For MRCP, the sensitivities ranged between 0.77 and 1.00 and the specificities ranged between 0.73 and 0.99. The summary sensitivity and specificity of the seven studies that evaluated MRCP (996 participants; 361 cases and 635 participants without common bile duct stones) were 0.93 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.96) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.90 to 0.98). There was no evidence of a difference in sensitivity or specificity between EUS and MRCP (P value = 0.5). From the included studies, at the median pre\u2010test probability of common bile duct stones of 41% the post\u2010test probabilities (with 95% CI) associated with positive and negative EUS test results were 0.96 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.98) and 0.03 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.06). At the same pre\u2010test probability, the post\u2010test probabilities associated with positive and negative MRCP test results were 0.94 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.97) and 0.05 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.09).    Authors' conclusions Both EUS and MRCP have high diagnostic accuracy for detection of common bile duct stones. People with positive EUS or MRCP should undergo endoscopic or surgical extraction of common bile duct stones and those with negative EUS or MRCP do not need further invasive tests. However, if the symptoms persist, further investigations will be indicated. The two tests are similar in terms of diagnostic accuracy and the choice of which test to use will be informed by availability and contra\u2010indications to each test. However, it should be noted that the results are based on studies of poor methodological quality and so the results should be interpreted with caution. Further studies that are of high methodological quality are necessary to determine the diagnostic accuracy of EUS and MRCP for the diagnosis of common bile duct stones.",

        "Types of studies": "We included studies providing cross\u2010sectional information comparing one or more of the index tests against a reference standard in the appropriate patient population (see Participants). We included studies irrespective of language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively. We planned to include comparative studies in which EUS and MRCP were performed in the same study population, either by giving all patients both index tests or by randomly allocating patients to receive MRCP or EUS. We planned to exclude diagnostic case\u2010control studies if there were at least four cross\u2010sectional or comparative studies.",

        "Reference standards": "We accepted the following reference standards. For test positives, we accepted confirmation of a common bile duct stone by extraction of the stone (irrespective of whether this was done by surgical or endoscopic methods).    For test negatives, we acknowledged that there was no way of being absolutely sure that there were no common bile duct stones. However, we accepted negative results by surgical or endoscopic negative exploration of the common bile duct, or symptom\u2010free follow\u2010up for at least six months as the reference standard. Surgical or endoscopic exploration is adequate but it is not commonly used in patients with negative index tests because of its invasive nature. Therefore, we accepted follow\u2010up as a less adequate reference test. Negative exploration of the common bile duct is likely to be a better reference standard than follow\u2010up for at least six months since most stones already present in the common bile duct are likely to be identified and extracted in this fashion. Six months is an arbitrary choice but we anticipated that most common bile duct stones will manifest during this period.
