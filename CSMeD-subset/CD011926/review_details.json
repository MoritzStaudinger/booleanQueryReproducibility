    "title": "Molecular assays for the diagnosis of sepsis in neonates",
    "abstract": "Background Microbial cultures for diagnosis of neonatal sepsis have low sensitivity and reporting delay. Advances in molecular microbiology have fostered new molecular assays that are rapid and may improve neonatal outcomes.    Objectives To assess the diagnostic accuracy of various molecular methods for the diagnosis of culture\u2010positive bacterial and fungal sepsis in neonates and to explore heterogeneity among studies by analyzing subgroups classified by gestational age and type of sepsis onset and compare molecular tests with one another.    Search methods We performed the systematic review as recommended by the Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy Working Group. On 19 January 2016, we searched electronic bibliographic databases (the Cochrane Library, PubMed (from 1966), Embase (from 1982), and CINAHL (from 1982)), conference proceedings of the Pediatric Academic Societies annual conference (from 1990), clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registry, and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Platform (ICTRP) Search portal), and Science Citation Index. We contacted experts in the field for studies.    Selection criteria We included studies that were prospective or retrospective, cohort or cross\u2010sectional design, which evaluated molecular assays (index test) in neonates with suspected sepsis (participants) in comparison with microbial cultures (reference standard).    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the methodologic quality of the studies and extracted data. We performed meta\u2010analyses using the bivariate and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) models and entered data into Review Manager 5.    Main results Thirty\u2010five studies were eligible for inclusion and the summary estimate of sensitivity was 0.90 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 0.95) and of specificity was 0.93 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.96) (moderate quality evidence). We explored heterogeneity by subgroup analyses of type of test, gestational age, type of sepsis onset, and prevalence of sepsis and we did not find sufficient explanations for the heterogeneity (moderate to very low quality evidence). Sensitivity analyses by including studies that analyzed blood samples and by good methodology revealed similar results (moderate quality evidence).    Authors' conclusions Molecular assays have the advantage of producing rapid results and may perform well as 'add\u2010on' tests.",

    "criteria": {
        "Types of studies": "We included prospective or retrospective, cohort or cross\u2010sectional studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of a molecular test in the clinical context of diagnosis of neonatal bacterial or fungal sepsis. We excluded studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the test using only positive samples or healthy controls and not in the clinical context of suspected neonatal bacterial or fungal sepsis.",
        "Participants": "Neonates with clinically suspected bacterial or fungal sepsis. Clinical signs and symptoms of sepsis in neonates can be nonspecific and hence a high index of clinical suspicion is required for the diagnosis. Neonates are defined as a newborn of 28 days of age or less. We defined gestational age subgroups of preterm and term infants as: preterm: neonates born at less than 37 completed weeks of gestation;   term: neonates born at 37 completed weeks of gestation or greater. preterm: neonates born at less than 37 completed weeks of gestation; term: neonates born at 37 completed weeks of gestation or greater. We made a post\u2010hoc decision to include data from studies that included infants aged more than 28 days if more than 50% of the study participants were under 28 days of age.",
        "Index tests": "We defined molecular assays as any assay that involves extraction and evaluation of nucleic acid from bacteria or fungi, and performed for the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. The results of the index test were dichotomous; positive or negative. We assessed the results of the index test with the reference standard done at approximately same time. In the event of the index test identifying a different organism compared to the reference standard or identifying an organism when the reference standard was negative, we discussed among our author group as to whether we should discard or include as a false positive based on whether it was a contaminant or not. We analyzed subgroups of type of molecular assay namely broad\u2010range conventional PCR, real\u2010time PCR, PCR followed by post\u2010PCR processing, multiplex PCR, staphylococcal PCR and fungal PCR. New tests/methodology may arrive in the future as the technology advances and we will address this by subgroup analyses and using year of publication as a covariate in future meta\u2010analyses. We excluded molecular methods assessing infections other than those caused by bacteria or fungi (e.g. viruses or protozoa).",
        "Target conditions": "Neonatal bacterial or fungal sepsis, defined as a neonate with a positive culture of bacteria or fungi from the blood or CSF, or both. We analyzed subgroups of type of sepsis onset namely early\u2010onset sepsis (EOS) (72 hours of age or less) and LOS (greater than 72 hours of age).",
        "Reference standards": "The reference standard for the diagnosis of sepsis was microbial culture of blood or CSF, or both, for bacteria or fungi, or both. Microbial cultures are generally assumed to have low sensitivity but this decreased sensitivity has not been quantified. The low sensitivity of cultures in neonates may be due to the low degree of neonatal bacteremia or fungemia, small inoculation volumes in culture bottles and the use of intrapartum antibiotics. We documented the participant characteristics, risk factors and outcomes of people who were index test positive and reference standard negative to gain insight into the sensitivity of the reference standard. Alternative tests, such as evaluation of acute phase reactants or cytokines, are often used in conjunction with blood cultures but do not have sufficient diagnostic accuracy to replace microbial cultures as the reference standard."

        "Appendix 3. QUADAS\u20102 methodologic assessment tool": "QUADAS\u20102 is structured so that four key domains are each rated in terms of the risk of bias and the concern regarding applicability to the research question (as defined above). Each key domain has a set of signaling questions to help reach the judgments regarding bias and applicability.   Domain 1: Participant selection  A. Risk of bias  Was a consecutive or random sample of participants enrolled? YES: if the articles clearly stated that a consecutive or random samples was enrolled; NO: if it was clear that this was not the case (e.g. if a study included participants 'at the discretion of the clinician'); UNCLEAR: in other cases where it was not clear if consecutive or random samples were enrolled.    Was a case\u2010control design avoided? YES: if the enrolled sample was a random or consecutive enrollment of neonates with suspected sepsis and not separate samples from sepsis\u2010positive participants and healthy controls; NO: if the enrolled samples consisted of sepsis\u2010confirmed cases and healthy controls; UNCLEAR: if the sampling regarding case\u2010control design was not clear.    Did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions? Inappropriate exclusions included neonates whose mothers were treated with antibiotics, neonates from mothers infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), etc. YES: if inappropriate exclusions were not found in the included study, NO: if reasons for inappropriate exclusion were found. Unclear: if there was no description of the inclusion and exclusion criteria and inappropriate exclusion could not be ascertained.    Could the selection of participants have introduced bias? LOW RISK: if all questions were scored \"YES\", or a maximum of one question with unclear.  HIGH RISK: if at least one question was scored as \"NO\".  UNCLEAR RISK: if at least two questions were scored as \"UNCLEAR\" and one as \"NO\".     B. Concerns regarding applicability  Was there concern that the included participants did not match the review question? LOW CONCERN: if all included participants were neonates according to our definition and if they were suspected of sepsis.  HIGH CONCERN: if at least 10% of the included participants were not neonates or not suspected of sepsis.  UNCLEAR CONCERN: if it is unclear whether the study fulfilled either the criteria for low concern or for high concern.      Domain 2: Index test(s) Describe the index test and how it was conducted and interpreted. If more than one index test was used, please complete for each test.   A. Risk of bias    Describe the index test and how it was conducted and interpreted     Were the index test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard?  YES: if people performing the molecular assays were blinded to the results of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (or both) cultures or if the index test was performed and interpreted prior to the reference standard; NO: if people performing the molecular assays had knowledge of the results of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (or both) cultures; UNCLEAR: if the study did not explicitly describe how the index test was conducted and interpreted.    If a threshold was used, was it prespecified? This signaling question is not applicable to the study as no thresholds were used in the conduct and interpretation of the index and the reference standards. Results of the tests were dichotomous and were reported as either positive or negative.    Could the conduct or interpretation of the index test have introduced bias? LOW RISK: if the study was performed blinded to the results of the reference standard.  HIGH RISK: if there was prior knowledge of the results of the reference standard.  UNCLEAR RISK: if there was no clear description of how the tests were conducted and interpreted.     B. Concerns regarding applicability  Was there concern that the index test, its conduct, or interpretation differed from the review question?  LOW CONCERN: if the index test used for the diagnosis of sepsis was a molecular assay as defined in our protocol and if the index test was interpreted without the knowledge of the results of the reference standard.  HIGH CONCERN: if the index test used for the diagnosis of sepsis varied from what was defined in the protocol and if the index test was interpreted with knowledge of the results of the reference standard.  UNCLEAR CONCERN: if it was unclear whether the study fulfilled criteria for \"low concern\" or \"high concern\" or if the study provided limited information regarding the conduct and interpretation of the index test.      Domain 3: Reference standard  A. Risk of bias    Describe the reference standard and how it was conducted and interpreted     Was the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition? YES: if the reference standard used was microbial culture of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (or both) in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. Microbial culture is currently the \"gold standard\" used in clinical practice in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis; NO: if the test used as reference standard was a test other than microbial culture; UNCLEAR: if there was no description of the reference standard or if microbial cultures were used in combination with an \"add\u2010on\" test.    Were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index test?  YES: if people evaluating the results of the microbial culture were blinded to the results of the molecular assays and if the reference standard was performed and interpreted prior to the index test; NO: if people evaluating the results of the microbial culture had knowledge of the results of the molecular assays; UNCLEAR: if the study did not explicitly describe how the reference standard was conducted and interpreted.    Could the reference standard, its conduct, or its interpretation have introduced bias? LOW RISK: if the reference standard used met the definition described in the protocol, performed and evaluated without knowledge of the results of the index test.  HIGH RISK: if the reference standard did not meet the definition described in the protocol or was evaluated with the knowledge of the results of the index test.  UNCLEAR RISK: if there was no clear description of the reference standard used, how it was performed and interpreted in relation to the results of the index test.     B. Concerns regarding applicability  Was there concern that the target condition as defined by the reference standard did not match the review question?  LOW CONCERN: if the reference standard was microbial culture of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (or both) and if the target condition was suspected sepsis in a neonate as defined in our protocol.  HIGH CONCERN: if the reference standard was a test other than microbial culture of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (or both) and if the target condition included participants other than neonates or if the participants were not suspected of neonatal sepsis.  UNCLEAR CONCERN: if it was unclear whether the study fulfilled either the criteria for \"low concern\" or for \"high concern\".      Domain 4: Flow and timing  A. Risk of bias    Describe any participants who did not receive the index test(s) or reference standard (or both) or who were excluded from the 2 \u00d7 2 table (refer to flow diagram).    Describe the time interval and any interventions between index test(s) and reference standard.      Was there an appropriate interval between index test(s) and reference standard? YES: if blood or cerebrospinal fluid (or both) samples used for both microbial culture and molecular assay were drawn concurrently at the same time during the workup for neonatal sepsis; NO: if blood or cerebrospinal fluid (or both) samples used for both microbial culture and molecular assay were drawn more than 6 hours apart for the workup of neonatal sepsis; UNCLEAR: if there was no description of how and when the samples for both the index text and the reference standard were collected.    Did all participants receive a reference standard? YES: if all participants underwent microbial culture testing for their blood or cerebrospinal fluid (or both); NO: if at least 1 participant did not have the reference standard performed. UNCLEAR: if the study did not describe clearly which participants received the reference standard and which ones did not.    Did participants receive the same reference standard? YES: if all participants underwent microbial culture testing for their blood or cerebrospinal fluid (or both); NO: if a different reference standard other than culture of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (or both) was used in at least 1 participant; UNCLEAR: if the study did not describe clearly what type of reference standard was used to diagnose a participant with neonatal sepsis.    Were all participants included in the analysis? YES: if all enrolled participants with the target condition who underwent testing using the index test and reference standard were included in the analysis; NO: if all enrolled participants were not accounted in the analysis; UNCLEAR: if it was unclear from the study about the inclusion of all enrolled participants in the analysis.    Could the participant flow have introduced bias? LOW CONCERN: if the answers to above questions were all \"YES\" which means that all participants enrolled in the study were subjected to the same reference standard and index test, clinical samples for testing were drawn concurrently from the same participant, and all participants were included in the final analysis.  HIGH CONCERN: if at least 2 questions had a \"NO\" answer.  UNCLEAR CONCERN: if at least 1 question had a \"NO\" answer or it was unclear whether the study fulfilled either the criteria for \"low concern\" or for \"high concern\".",

        "Could the reference standard, its conduct, or its interpretation have introduced bias?": "LOW RISK: if the reference standard used met the definition described in the protocol, performed and evaluated without knowledge of the results of the index test.  HIGH RISK: if the reference standard did not meet the definition described in the protocol or was evaluated with the knowledge of the results of the index test.  UNCLEAR RISK: if there was no clear description of the reference standard used, how it was performed and interpreted in relation to the results of the index test.",
        "Was there concern that the target condition as defined by the reference standard did not match the review question?": "LOW CONCERN: if the reference standard was microbial culture of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (or both) and if the target condition was suspected sepsis in a neonate as defined in our protocol.  HIGH CONCERN: if the reference standard was a test other than microbial culture of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (or both) and if the target condition included participants other than neonates or if the participants were not suspected of neonatal sepsis.  UNCLEAR CONCERN: if it was unclear whether the study fulfilled either the criteria for \"low concern\" or for \"high concern\".",
        "Domain 4: Flow and timing": "A. Risk of bias    Describe any participants who did not receive the index test(s) or reference standard (or both) or who were excluded from the 2 \u00d7 2 table (refer to flow diagram).    Describe the time interval and any interventions between index test(s) and reference standard.      Was there an appropriate interval between index test(s) and reference standard? YES: if blood or cerebrospinal fluid (or both) samples used for both microbial culture and molecular assay were drawn concurrently at the same time during the workup for neonatal sepsis; NO: if blood or cerebrospinal fluid (or both) samples used for both microbial culture and molecular assay were drawn more than 6 hours apart for the workup of neonatal sepsis; UNCLEAR: if there was no description of how and when the samples for both the index text and the reference standard were collected.    Did all participants receive a reference standard? YES: if all participants underwent microbial culture testing for their blood or cerebrospinal fluid (or both); NO: if at least 1 participant did not have the reference standard performed. UNCLEAR: if the study did not describe clearly which participants received the reference standard and which ones did not.    Did participants receive the same reference standard? YES: if all participants underwent microbial culture testing for their blood or cerebrospinal fluid (or both); NO: if a different reference standard other than culture of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (or both) was used in at least 1 participant; UNCLEAR: if the study did not describe clearly what type of reference standard was used to diagnose a participant with neonatal sepsis.    Were all participants included in the analysis? YES: if all enrolled participants with the target condition who underwent testing using the index test and reference standard were included in the analysis; NO: if all enrolled participants were not accounted in the analysis; UNCLEAR: if it was unclear from the study about the inclusion of all enrolled participants in the analysis.    Could the participant flow have introduced bias? LOW CONCERN: if the answers to above questions were all \"YES\" which means that all participants enrolled in the study were subjected to the same reference standard and index test, clinical samples for testing were drawn concurrently from the same participant, and all participants were included in the final analysis.  HIGH CONCERN: if at least 2 questions had a \"NO\" answer.  UNCLEAR CONCERN: if at least 1 question had a \"NO\" answer or it was unclear whether the study fulfilled either the criteria for \"low concern\" or for \"high concern\".",
