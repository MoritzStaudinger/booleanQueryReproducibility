    "title": "Amylase in drain fluid for the diagnosis of pancreatic leak in post\u2010pancreatic resection",
    "abstract": "Background The treatment of people with clinically significant postoperative pancreatic leaks is different from those without clinically significant pancreatic leaks. It is important to know the diagnostic accuracy of drain fluid amylase as a triage test for the detection of clinically significant pancreatic leaks, so that an informed decision can be made as to whether the patient with a suspected pancreatic leak needs further investigations and treatment. There is currently no systematic review of the diagnostic test accuracy of drain fluid amylase for the diagnosis of clinically relevant pancreatic leak.    Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of amylase in drain fluid at 48 hours or more for the diagnosis of pancreatic leak in people who had undergone pancreatic resection.    Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Science Citation Index Expanded, and the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment (NIHR HTA) websites up to 20 February 2017. We searched the references of the included studies to identify additional studies. We did not restrict studies based on language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively. We also performed a 'related search' and 'citing reference' search in MEDLINE and Embase.    Selection criteria We included all studies that evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of amylase in the drain fluid at 48 hours or more for the diagnosis of pancreatic leak in people who had undergone pancreatic resection excluding total pancreatectomy. We planned to exclude case\u2010control studies because these studies are prone to bias, but did not find any. At least two authors independently searched and screened the references produced by the search to identify relevant studies.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. The included studies reported drain fluid amylase on different postoperative days and measured at different cut\u2010off levels, so it was not possible to perform a meta\u2010analysis using the bivariate model as planned. We have reported the sensitivity, specificity, post\u2010test probability of a positive and negative drain fluid amylase along with 95% confidence interval (CI) on each of the different postoperative days and measured at different cut\u2010off levels.    Main results A total of five studies including 868 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. The five studies included in this review reported the value of drain fluid amylase at different thresholds and different postoperative days. The sensitivities and specificities were variable; the sensitivities ranged between 0.72 and 1.00 while the specificities ranged between 0.73 and 0.99 for different thresholds on different postoperative days. At the median prevalence (pre\u2010test probability) of 15.9%, the post\u2010test probabilities for pancreatic leak ranged between 35.9% and 95.4% for a positive drain fluid amylase test and ranged between 0% and 5.5% for a negative drain fluid amylase test.  None of the studies used the reference standard of confirmation by surgery or by a combination of surgery and clinical follow\u2010up, but used the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) grade B and C as the reference standard. The overall methodological quality was unclear or high in all the studies.    Authors' conclusions Because of the paucity of data and methodological deficiencies in the studies, we are uncertain whether drain fluid amylase should be used as a method for testing for pancreatic leak in an unselected population after pancreatic resection; and we judge that the optimal cut\u2010off of drain fluid amylase for making the diagnosis of pancreatic leak is also not clear. Further well\u2010designed diagnostic test accuracy studies with pre\u2010specified index test threshold of drain fluid amylase (at three times more on postoperative day 5 or another suitable pre\u2010specified threshold), appropriate follow\u2010up (for at least six to eight weeks to ensure that there are no pancreatic leaks), and clearly defined reference standards (of surgical, clinical, and radiological confirmation of pancreatic leak) are important to reliably determine the diagnostic accuracy of drain fluid amylase in the diagnosis of pancreatic leak.",

        "Types of studies": "We included all studies that evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of amylase in drain fluid for the diagnosis of clinically significant pancreatic leak in people who had undergone pancreatic resection excluding total pancreatectomy. We included studies that provided information on the index test and reference standards irrespective of language or publication status, or whether the data was collected prospectively or retrospectively. However, we excluded case reports that describe how the diagnosis of pancreatic leak was made on an individual participant or a group of participants and which did not provide sufficient diagnostic test accuracy data, i.e. true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative. We also excluded case\u2010control studies because these studies are prone to bias (Whiting 2011).",

        "Reference standards": "We planned to accept one of the following reference standards as per our review protocol. However, according to these reference standards we could not have included any studies as none of the studies reported used one of the two reference standards below. Pancreatic leak confirmed at surgery. This is confirmation of pancreatic leak at surgery usually on the basis of the presence of partial or complete separation of the anastomosis allowing leakage of contents, abdominal collections, or fistula (a tract between the anastomosis and exterior), and is a subjective decision made by the surgeon. Nevertheless, this is the best reference standard available.    Pancreatic leak confirmed at surgery for participants with elevated amylase and clinical follow\u2010up for a minimum period of six weeks (to ensure that they do not have complications due to pancreatic leak such as abdominal collections requiring drainage, intra\u2010abdominal sepsis, generalised sepsis resulting from intra\u2010abdominal sepsis, or mortality due to intra\u2010abdominal sepsis) in people with negative amylase. The clinical follow\u2010up should have included clinical examination of the patient, and may or may not have included radiological follow\u2010up done as follow\u2010up of suspected pancreatic leak or routine radiological follow\u2010up to detect the recurrence of cancer. In retrospective studies, we accepted hospital records of physical examination of the patient after a minimum follow\u2010up period of six weeks as an acceptable reference standard. The presence of one or more complications due to pancreatic leak such as abdominal collections requiring drainage, intra\u2010abdominal sepsis, generalised sepsis resulting from intra\u2010abdominal sepsis, or mortality due to intra\u2010abdominal sepsis was considered as a positive reference standard.

Because of the lack of any studies using one of the two reference standards mentioned above, we accepted ISGPF grades B and C POPF as reference standards. People with grade C POPF require surgery while those with grade B POPF usually do not undergo surgery but may require additional radiological drainage (Bassi 2005). These people with grade B POPF do not have systemic sepsis but have localised intra\u2010abdominal infection. Although the intra\u2010abdominal infections are usually because of pancreatic leaks in people undergoing pancreatic resection (these leaks are usually at least partially 'contained' (i.e. the effects limited) by the body's defence mechanism), one cannot be sure that the intra\u2010abdominal infection was because of pancreatic leak. So, the reference standards used in this review might misclassify the target condition of pancreatic leak."
