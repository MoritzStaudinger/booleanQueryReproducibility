    "title": "Serum amylase and lipase and urinary trypsinogen and amylase for diagnosis of acute pancreatitis",
    "abstract": "Background The treatment of people with acute abdominal pain differs if they have acute pancreatitis. It is important to know the diagnostic accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen\u20102, and urinary amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, so that an informed decision can be made as to whether the person with abdominal pain has acute pancreatitis. There is currently no Cochrane review of the diagnostic test accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen\u20102, and urinary amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.    Objectives To compare the diagnostic accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen\u20102, and urinary amylase, either alone or in combination, in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in people with acute onset of a persistent, severe epigastric pain or diffuse abdominal pain.    Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR HTA and DARE), and other databases until March 2017. We searched the references of the included studies to identify additional studies. We did not restrict studies based on language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively. We also performed a 'related search' and 'citing reference' search in MEDLINE and Embase.    Selection criteria We included all studies that evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen\u20102, and urinary amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. We excluded case\u2010control studies because these studies are prone to bias. We accepted any of the following reference standards: biopsy, consensus conference definition, radiological features of acute pancreatitis, diagnosis of acute pancreatitis during laparotomy or autopsy, and organ failure. At least two review authors independently searched and screened the references located by the search to identify relevant studies.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. The thresholds used for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis varied in the trials, resulting in sparse data for each index test. Because of sparse data, we used \u20102 log likelihood values to determine which model to use for meta\u2010analysis. We calculated and reported the sensitivity, specificity, post\u2010test probability of a positive and negative index test along with 95% confidence interval (CI) for each cutoff, but have reported only the results of the recommended cutoff of three times normal for serum amylase and serum lipase, and the manufacturer\u2010recommended cutoff of 50 mg/mL for urinary trypsinogen\u20102 in the abstract.    Main results Ten studies including 5056 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review and assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the index tests in people presenting to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain. The risk of bias was unclear or high for all of the included studies. The study that contributed approximately two\u2010thirds of the participants included in this review was excluded from the results of the analysis presented below due to major concerns about the participants included in the study. We have presented only the results where at least two studies were included in the analysis.  Serum amylase, serum lipase, and urinary trypsinogen\u20102 at the standard threshold levels of more than three times normal for serum amylase and serum lipase, and a threshold of 50 ng/mL for urinary trypsinogen\u20102 appear to have similar sensitivities (0.72 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.82); 0.79 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.92); and 0.72 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.84), respectively) and specificities (0.93 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.99); 0.89 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.99); and 0.90 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.93), respectively). At the median prevalence of 22.6% of acute pancreatitis in the studies, out of 100 people with positive test, serum amylase (more than three times normal), serum lipase (more than three times normal), and urinary trypsinogen (more than 50 ng/mL), 74 (95% CI 33 to 94); 68 (95% CI 21 to 94); and 67 (95% CI 57 to 76) people have acute pancreatitis, respectively; out of 100 people with negative test, serum amylase (more than three times normal), serum lipase (more than three times normal), and urinary trypsinogen (more than 50 ng/mL), 8 (95% CI 5 to 12); 7 (95% CI 3 to 15); and 8 (95% CI 5 to 13) people have acute pancreatitis, respectively. We were not able to compare these tests formally because of sparse data.    Authors' conclusions As about a quarter of people with acute pancreatitis fail to be diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis with the evaluated tests, one should have a low threshold to admit the patient and treat them for acute pancreatitis if the symptoms are suggestive of acute pancreatitis, even if these tests are normal. About 1 in 10 patients without acute pancreatitis may be wrongly diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis with these tests, therefore it is important to consider other conditions that require urgent surgical intervention, such as perforated viscus, even if these tests are abnormal.  The diagnostic performance of these tests decreases even further with the progression of time, and one should have an even lower threshold to perform additional investigations if the symptoms are suggestive of acute pancreatitis.",

        "Types of studies": "We included studies that evaluated the accuracy of the index tests mentioned above in the appropriate patient population (see below). We included relevant studies irrespective of language or publication status (i.e. published as full text or abstract), whether the data were collected prospectively or retrospectively, and whether there was a comparison between the tests. However, we excluded case reports (which describe how the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was made on an individual patient or a group of patients and which do not provide sufficient diagnostic test accuracy data, i.e. true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative). We also excluded case\u2010control studies because they are prone to bias (Whiting 2011).",
        "Participants": "Adults with acute epigastric or diffuse abdominal pain (with or without previous history of acute pancreatitis and with or without systemic signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis), presenting to the hospital within three days of the onset of symptoms, irrespective of the interval between onset of symptoms and the time at which the test was performed.",
        "Index tests": "Serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen, and urinary amylase either alone or in combination. A variety of kits are available for measuring these tests. We included kits from all manufacturers, and included studies irrespective of the threshold used. Although we did not plan to include repeat tests, the diagnostic test accuracy of these index tests on later days might give some indication of the performance of these tests in patients with a prolonged period of symptoms before going to the hospital. We have therefore analysed and reported this information separately from the tests conducted on admission.",
        "Target conditions": "Acute pancreatitis (regardless of severity: mild, moderately severe, or severe)",
        "Reference standards": "While inflammation of the pancreas confirmed by biopsy can be considered to be the gold standard for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, for ethical reasons it is unlikely to be performed in any participant. As a result, different study authors may use different reference standards such as radiological features of acute pancreatitis or the presence of organ failure. However, such reference standards may miss some cases of mild acute pancreatitis, which will result in an underestimation of diagnostic test accuracy of the index tests. We also accepted the consensus conference definition of acute pancreatitis, that is when at least two of the following three features are present (Banks 2013). Acute onset of a persistent, severe epigastric pain often radiating to the back.   Serum lipase activity (or amylase activity) at least three times greater than the upper limit of normal.    Characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on CECT, and less commonly on MRI or transabdominal ultrasonography. Acute onset of a persistent, severe epigastric pain often radiating to the back. Serum lipase activity (or amylase activity) at least three times greater than the upper limit of normal. Characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on CECT, and less commonly on MRI or transabdominal ultrasonography. We also accepted any of the following reference standards, used alone or in combination: biopsy, radiological features of acute pancreatitis (CT or MRI), diagnosis of acute pancreatitis during laparotomy or autopsy, organ failure, or the consensus conference definition (including or excluding the index test being evaluated). In terms of ranking the reference standards, we considered biopsy to be the best reference standard (although for ethical reasons it is unlikely to have been performed in any participant) followed by the consensus definition of acute pancreatitis; radiological, laparotomy, or autopsy features of acute pancreatitis; or the presence of organ failure, in that order. However, we anticipated that the authors would exclude the test being assessed to be incorporated into the reference standard. For example, if serum amylase was being evaluated, the final diagnosis of acute pancreatitis would not depend upon the levels of serum amylase; this was not the case, as described below. If the test being assessed was incorporated into the reference standard, the diagnostic accuracy of the test would be overestimated."

        "Appendix 11. Statistical methods that were planned but not performed because of paucity of data": "The statistical analysis and data synthesis below were planned but could not be performed because of the paucity of data.  We planned to stratify the analysis by the different reference standards (i.e. we planned to use different reference standards as different index tests). However, because of paucity of data, we did not stratify the studies based on reference standards.  We planned to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the different tests by including a single covariate term for test type in the bivariate model to estimate differences in the sensitivity and specificity of the tests. We planned to consider a combination of tests for each of the scenarios (any test positive or all tests positive) as different index tests. We planned to allow the variances of the random effects and their covariance to also depend on test type, thus allowing the variances to differ between tests. We planned to use the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics curve (HSROC) to test hypotheses about whether one test is superior to another and to investigate heterogeneity (Rutter 2001). For this purpose, we planned to combine tests irrespective of the thresholds and reference standards. We used the HSROC model to compare whether one test is superior to another since the HSROC model allows combining tests regardless of the thresholds and might overcome the problem of a limited number of studies included under each threshold. In case the study reported results at multiple thresholds, we used the threshold used by the authors for primary analysis for inclusion in the HSROC model. We planned to use likelihood ratio tests to compare the model with and without covariate (test type). We planned to use a P value of less than 0.05 for the likelihood ratio test to indicate differences in diagnostic accuracy between the tests. We also planned to compare the estimates of sensitivity and specificity between models to check the robustness of our assumptions about the variances of the random effects. If at least four studies that evaluated different tests in the same study population were available (e.g. in studies that perform more than one index test in all of the participants, individual index tests and combination of index tests in all of the participants, or randomised controlled trials in which participants have been randomised to the different index tests), we planned to perform a direct head\u2010to\u2010head comparison by limiting the test comparison to such studies. We also planned to present the relative sensitivities and relative specificities of the index tests from the direct comparisons in a table.  We planned to create a graph of pre\u2010test probabilities (using the observed median and range of prevalence from the included studies) against post\u2010test probabilities for each test stratified by different thresholds and reference standards. We planned to calculate the post\u2010test probabilities using these pre\u2010test probabilities and the summary positive and negative likelihood ratios. We planned to report the summary sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and post\u2010test probabilities for the median, lower quartile, and upper quartile of the pre\u2010test probabilities. However, because of paucity of data, we did not present the pre\u2010test probability versus post\u2010test probability graph. We have not presented the likelihood ratios, as we had to provide the most important information in the table for a number of comparisons."
