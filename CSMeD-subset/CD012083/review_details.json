    "title": "Ultrasonography for confirmation of gastric tube placement",
    "abstract": "Background Gastric tubes are commonly used for the administration of drugs and tube feeding for people who are unable to swallow. Feeding via a tube misplaced in the trachea can result in severe pneumonia. Therefore, the confirmation of tube placement in the stomach after tube insertion is important. Recent studies have reported that ultrasonography provides good diagnostic accuracy estimates in the confirmation of appropriate tube placement. Hence, ultrasound could provide a promising alternative to X\u2010rays in the confirmation of tube placement, especially in settings where X\u2010ray facilities are unavailable or difficult to access.    Objectives To assess the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for gastric tube placement confirmation.   Search methods We searched the Cochrane Library (2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE (to March 2016), Embase (to March 2016), National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) PROSPERO Register (to May 2016), Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility Databases (to May 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (to May 2016), ISRCTN registry (May 2016), World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to May 2016) and reference lists of articles, and contacted study authors.    Selection criteria We included studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of naso\u2010 and orogastric tube placement confirmed by ultrasound visualization using X\u2010ray visualization as the reference standard. We included cross\u2010sectional studies, and case\u2010control studies. We excluded case series or case reports. Studies were excluded if X\u2010ray visualization was not the reference standard or if the tube being placed was a gastrostomy or enteric tube.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from each of the included studies. We contacted authors of the included studies to obtain missing data.    Main results We identified 10 studies (545 participants and 560 tube insertions) which met our inclusion criteria.  No study was assigned low risk of bias or low concern in every QUADAS\u20102 domain. We judged only three (30%) studies to have low risk of bias in the participant selection domain because they performed ultrasound after they confirmed correct position by other methods.  Few data (43 participants) were available for misplacement detection (specificity) due to the low incidence of misplacement. We did not perform a meta\u2010analysis because of considerable heterogeneity of the index test such as the difference of echo window, the combination of ultrasound with other confirmation methods (e.g. saline flush visualization by ultrasound) and ultrasound during the insertion of the tube. For all settings, sensitivity estimates for individual studies ranged from 0.50 to 1.00 and specificity estimates from 0.17 to 1.00. For settings where X\u2010ray was not readily available and participants underwent gastric tube insertion for drainage (four studies, 305 participants), sensitivity estimates of ultrasound in combination with other confirmatory tests ranged from 0.86 to 0.98 and specificity estimates of 1.00 with wide confidence intervals.  For the studies using ultrasound alone (four studies, 314 participants), sensitivity estimates ranged from 0.91 to 0.98 and specificity estimates from 0.67 to 1.00.    Authors' conclusions Of 10 studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of gastric tube placement, few studies had a low risk of bias. Based on limited evidence, ultrasound does not have sufficient accuracy as a single test to confirm gastric tube placement. However, in settings where X\u2010ray is not readily available, ultrasound may be useful to detect misplaced gastric tubes. Larger studies are needed to determine the possibility of adverse events when ultrasound is used to confirm tube placement.",

        "Types of studies": "We included studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of naso\u2010 and orogastric tube placement confirmed by ultrasound visualization and using X\u2010ray visualization as the reference standard. We included cross\u2010sectional studies and case\u2010control studies. We excluded case series or case reports (Bossuyt 2008). We excluded studies where X\u2010ray visualization was not the reference standard or if the tube being placed was a gastrostomy or enteric tube. We defined gastrostomy tubes as tubes for percutaneous enteric access and enteric tubes as both nasal or oral gastrojejunal tubes and small bowel tubes (Schattner 1997). We excluded studies if we could not extract TP, FN, FP and TN values.",
        "Participants": "Both adults (aged greater than 16 years) and children (aged 16 years or less) who needed gastric tube placement.",
        "Index tests": "Ultrasonographic confirmation of gastric tube placement. We included all studies regardless of where the ultrasound test was performed (e.g. bedside or X\u2010ray department) or who performed and interpreted the test (e.g. ultrasonographer or physician).",
        "Target conditions": "The target condition was appropriate gastric tube placement for any reason.",
        "Reference standards": "The reference standard was X\u2010ray of the chest or abdomen (X\u2010ray visualization). If misinterpretation of the X\u2010ray was not reported in the included studies, we considered X\u2010ray of the chest or abdomen to have 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity."

Index test (where was the echo window of the tube?)   Portable ultrasound system (Titan, Sonosite, Bothell, WA) with a microconvex probe (2\u2010A MHz). Technique standardized; probe placed transversely on anterior neck just superior to suprasternal notch in midline at level of thyroid gland and focused on visible part of the oesophagus (Figure 1 of publication), with longitudinal and transversal viewing, then probe placed in subxiphoid area and oriented towards left upper abdominal quadrant to visualize stomach (Figure 2 of publication), with transverse and longitudinal viewing. The antrum was imaged in transversal plane in epigastric area using left lobe of liver as an internal landmark, angling the transducer towards left subcostal area to image gastric body. Ultrasound examination was considered as positive when GT was visualized, appearing as an hyperechogenic circle posterior to the thyroid tissue adjacent to the trachea (Figure 1 of publication), and as a hyperechogenic line in stomach (Figure 2 of publication). When GT was seen in oesophagus and not in stomach, 50 mL of air were injected through the GT, if ultrasonography showed dynamic fogging in the stomach, GT was considered in stomach.

Signalling question 1: was a consecutive or random sample of participants enrolled?  Signalling question 2: was a case\u2010control design avoided?  Signalling question 3: did the study avoid reinsertion of the tube when participants coughed too much?  Signalling question 4: did the study avoid reinsertion of the tube when participants did not make a bubbling sound?  Signalling question 5 and 6: did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions?  Coughing or the absence of bubbling sounds indicates misplacement of tubes into the airway. If participants experience these tests and receive reinsertion based on the results, referral bias is suspected. In addition, anatomical variation of the neck structure (e.g. larynx, pharynx) may make insertion of gastric tubes more difficult (Der Kureghian 2011; Holland 2013). This point may also affect the difficulty of visualizing the tubes by ultrasound. We classified as 'yes' those studies that excluded people who had difficulties with nasogastric tube insertion or visualization, 'no' for those studies where people did not experience such difficulties and 'unclear' where this information was not clear.    Applicability: were there concerns that the included participants and the setting did not match the review question?  The inclusion criteria for this review specified studies in which the participants were considered to require gastric tube insertion (not including transpyloric tube) for any reason. Therefore, we anticipated that all the studies in the review were judged as 'low' concern.     Domain 2: index test  Risk of bias: could the conduct or interpretation of the index test have introduced bias?  Signalling question 1: were the index test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard?  We classified the study as 'yes' if ultrasound test results were interpreted without knowledge of the reference standard or if ultrasound test results were interpreted before the X\u2010ray test, 'no' if the ultrasound tests were interpreted with knowledge of the reference standard results and 'unclear' if this information was not clear.    Applicability: were there concerns that the index test, its conduct or interpretation differed from the review question?  Confirmation of gastric tube placement by ultrasound was an inclusion criterion for this review, so we anticipated that all studies were classified as 'low' concern.     Domain 3: reference standard  Risk of bias: could the reference standard, its conduct or its interpretation have introduced bias?  Signalling question 1: is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition?  Signalling question 2: were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index test?  Signalling question 3: were the criteria of reference standard for target condition prespecified?  We classified the studies as 'yes' if the criteria for appropriate gastric tube placement were checked by X\u2010ray visualization, 'no' if the criteria for verification of placement were by any other methods and 'unclear' if this information was not clear. We classified the study as 'yes' if X\u2010ray visualization results were interpreted without knowledge of the index test, 'no' if the X\u2010ray visualization was interpreted with knowledge of the index test results and 'unclear' if this information was not clear. We classified the study as 'yes' if the criteria of reference standard for target condition were prespecified, 'no' if the criteria of reference standard for target condition were not prespecified and 'unclear' if this information was not clear.    Applicability: were there concerns that the target condition as defined by the reference standard did not match the review question?  The target condition is the appropriate placement of a gastric tube in the stomach via the nose or mouth, which may be improved by the use of prespecified diagnostic criteria for chest X\u2010ray interpretation (Lamont 2011). We evaluated those studies that used clear diagnostic criteria for X\u2010ray visualization interpretation as 'low' concern, those that did not use any criteria or where the interpretation was based on an individual clinician's interpretation as 'high' concern and 'unclear' concern if this information was not clear.     Domain 4: flow and timing  Risk of bias: could the participant flow have introduced bias? Signalling question 1: did all participants receive the same reference standard?  Signalling question 2: was there an appropriate interval between the index test and reference standard?  Signalling question 3: were all participants included in the analysis?  We classified the study as 'yes' if all participants had the same reference standard, 'no' if the reference standard was different from chest or abdominal X\u2010ray and 'unclear' if this information was not clear. If a gastric tube was correctly inserted and initial gastric tube placement was confirmed, continual assessment is still required because some routine activities (e.g. vomiting, coughing, retching) may cause tube displacement (Simons 2012). Therefore, any delay in testing may influence results. However, we set an arbitrary time delay between tests in line with the AACCN 2009, which recommends tube location to be checked at four\u2010hourly intervals (Simons 2012). We classified the study as 'yes' if the delay was less than four hours, 'no' if the delay was four hours or more and 'unclear' if the information was not clear.  Uninterpretable results may be present (e.g. unclear chest X\u2010ray or ultrasound). Additionally, withdrawals from the study may be present. We classified the study as 'yes' if uninterpretable results were reported and the study had no withdrawals or the withdrawals were unlikely to affect the results, 'no' if uninterpretable results were not reported or there were withdrawals that were likely to affect the results, or both, and 'unclear' if this information was not clear.",
