    "title": "Combination of the non\u2010invasive tests for the diagnosis of endometriosis",
    "abstract": "Background About 10% of women of reproductive age suffer from endometriosis, a costly chronic disease causing pelvic pain and subfertility. Laparoscopy is the gold standard diagnostic test for endometriosis, but is expensive and carries surgical risks. Currently, there are no non\u2010invasive tests available in clinical practice to accurately diagnose endometriosis. This review assessed the diagnostic accuracy of combinations of different non\u2010invasive testing modalities for endometriosis and provided a summary of all the reviews in the non\u2010invasive tests for endometriosis series.    Objectives To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of any combination of non\u2010invasive tests for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis (peritoneal and/or ovarian or deep infiltrating) compared to surgical diagnosis as a reference standard. The combined tests were evaluated as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery and triage tests to assist decision\u2010making to undertake diagnostic surgery for endometriosis.    Search methods We did not restrict the searches to particular study designs, language or publication dates. We searched CENTRAL to July 2015, MEDLINE and EMBASE to May 2015, as well as the following databases to April 2015: CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, LILACS, OAIster, TRIP, ClinicalTrials.gov, DARE and PubMed.    Selection criteria We considered published, peer\u2010reviewed, randomised controlled or cross\u2010sectional studies of any size, including prospectively collected samples from any population of women of reproductive age suspected of having one or more of the following target conditions: ovarian, peritoneal or deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). We included studies comparing the diagnostic test accuracy of a combination of several testing modalities with the findings of surgical visualisation of endometriotic lesions.    Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently collected and performed a quality assessment of the data from each study by using the QUADAS\u20102 tool. For each test, the data were classified as positive or negative for the surgical detection of endometriosis and sensitivity and specificity estimates were calculated. The bivariate model was planned to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity whenever sufficient data were available. The predetermined criteria for a clinically useful test to replace diagnostic surgery were a sensitivity of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.79 to detect endometriosis. We set the criteria for triage tests at a sensitivity of 0.95 and above and a specificity of 0.50 and above, which 'rules out' the diagnosis with high accuracy if there is a negative test result (SnOUT test), or a sensitivity of 0.50 and above and a specificity of 0.95 and above, which 'rules in' the diagnosis with high accuracy if there is a positive result (SpIN test).    Main results Eleven eligible studies included 1339 participants. All the studies were of poor methodological quality. Seven studies evaluated pelvic endometriosis, one study considered DIE and/or ovarian endometrioma, two studies differentiated endometrioma from other ovarian cysts and one study addressed mapping DIE at specific anatomical sites. Fifteen different diagnostic combinations were assessed, including blood, urinary or endometrial biomarkers, transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and clinical history or examination. We did not pool estimates of sensitivity and specificity, as each study analysed independent combinations of the non\u2010invasive tests.  Tests that met the criteria for a replacement test were: a combination of serum IL\u20106 (cut\u2010off >15.4 pg/ml) and endometrial PGP 9.5 for pelvic endometriosis (sensitivity 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.00), specificity 0.93 (95% CI, 0.80, 0.98) and the combination of vaginal examination and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) for rectal endometriosis (sensitivity 0.96 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.99), specificity 0.98 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.00)). Tests that met the criteria for SpIN triage tests for pelvic endometriosis were: 1. a multiplication of urine vitamin\u2010D\u2010binding protein (VDBP) and serum CA\u2010125 (cut\u2010off >2755) (sensitivity 0.74 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.84), specificity 0.97 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.00)) and 2. a combination of history (length of menses), serum CA\u2010125 (cut\u2010off >35 U/ml) and endometrial leukocytes (sensitivity 0.61 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.69), specificity 0.95 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.98)). For endometrioma, the following combinations qualified as SpIN test: 1. TVUS and either serum CA\u2010125 (cut\u2010off \u226525 U/ml) or CA 19.9 (cut\u2010off \u226512 U/ml) (sensitivity 0.79 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.91), specificity 0.97 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.00)); 2. TVUS and serum CA 19.9 (cut\u2010off \u226512 U/ml) (sensitivity 0.54 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.70), specificity 0.97 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.0)); 3\u20104. TVUS and serum CA\u2010125 (cut\u2010off \u226520 U/ml or cut\u2010off \u226525 U/ml) (sensitivity 0.69 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.85), specificity 0.96 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.99)); 5. TVUS and serum CA\u2010125 (cut\u2010off \u226535 U/ml) (sensitivity 0.52 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.71), specificity 0.97 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.00)). A combination of vaginal examination and TVUS reached the threshold for a SpIN test for obliterated pouch of Douglas (sensitivity 0.87 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.96), specificity 0.98 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.00)), vaginal wall endometriosis (sensitivity 0.82 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.95), specificity 0.99 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.0)) and rectovaginal septum endometriosis (sensitivity 0.88 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.00), specificity 0.99 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.00)).  All the tests were evaluated in individual studies and displayed wide CIs. Due to the heterogeneity and high risk of bias of the included studies, the clinical utility of the studied combination diagnostic tests for endometriosis remains unclear.    Authors' conclusions None of the biomarkers evaluated in this review could be evaluated in a meaningful way and there was insufficient or poor\u2010quality evidence. Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis and using any non\u2010invasive tests should only be undertaken in a research setting.",

        "Types of studies": "Published peer\u2010reviewed studies that compared the results of a combination of several testing modalities with the results obtained from a surgical diagnosis of endometriosis. Studies were included if they included the following study designs. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs).   Observational studies with the following designs.   Single\u2010gate design (studies with a single set of inclusion criteria defined by clinical presentation). All participants had clinically suspected endometriosis.    Two\u2010gate design (studies where participants are sampled from distinct populations with respect to clinical presentation). The same study includes participants with a clinical suspicion of having the target condition (e.g. women with pelvic pain) and also participants in whom the target condition is not suspected (e.g. women admitted for tubal ligation). Two\u2010gate studies were eligible only where all cases and controls belonged to the same population with respect to the reference standard (i.e. all the participants were scheduled for laparoscopy) (Rutjes 2005).      For studies on biological samples \u2010 performed on prospectively collected samples, irrespective of the actual time of the test assay. The timing of sample collection relative to surgery is important because the surgical excision of endometriotic lesions could influence biomarker expression and hence bias the results. Therefore, we only included studies where the biological sample was collected before the surgical procedure, i.e. prospectively collected. We considered to be eligible the studies performed on tissue bank samples collected from prospectively recruited, well\u2010defined populations, which prevented the omission of valuable data from adequately designed studies. The time interval between sample collection and laboratory testing may influence test outcomes, which could be dependent on sample storage conditions and the stability of each individual biomarker during storage and freeze\u2010thawing. This information was not readily available for most molecules, and we did not address it in this review, but we will consider it in future updates if more evidence emerges.

        "Participants": "Study participants included women of reproductive age (puberty to menopause) with suspected endometriosis based on clinical symptoms or pelvic examination, who undertook both the index test and reference standard. The participants were selected from populations of women undergoing abdominal surgery for the following indications: 1) clinically suspected endometriosis (pelvic pain, infertility, abnormal pelvic examination, or a combination of the above); 2) ovarian mass, regardless of symptoms; 3) a mixed group, which consists of women with suspected endometriosis/ovarian mass or women with other benign gynaecological conditions (e.g. surgical sterilisation, fibroid uterus, etc). Asymptomatic women who had an incidental finding of endometriosis at surgery performed for another indication were also included. Studies that included participants of postmenopausal age were eligible when the data for the reproductive age group was available in isolation. We excluded studies with participants that clearly would not undergo the index test in the relevant clinical situation or would not benefit from the test (e.g. women with ectopic pregnancies or acute pelvic inflammatory disease). We also excluded publications that only analysed participants with a positive index test or reference standard and did not provide data for the whole cohort.",
        "Index tests": "We assessed any combination of non\u2010invasive tests for endometriosis comprising of more than one test modality. This included the combinations of blood, endometrial, urine and imaging tests with or without clinical parameters, such as pre\u2010defined examination findings, specific symptoms or characteristics (e.g. length of menstrual cycle). The assessed index tests are presented in Table 2. The panel of biomarkers from the same single category (e.g. several blood biomarkers or combination of imaging methods) was assessed in the relevant review on the topic and are presented separately in other reviews from this series. The studies that solely assessed specific technical aspects, qualitative description of lesion appearance or interobserver variability of the index tests without reporting the data on diagnostic performance were excluded from the review. When the evaluated biomarker(s) showed differential expression between the groups of women with and without endometriosis, the publication was considered only if the data were reported with sufficient detail for the construction of 2 x 2 contingency tables. However, when the contingency tables were not available because the expression level of index test did not significantly differ between the groups and the inclusion criteria were otherwise met, we made a critical appraisal and presented the study in the descriptive part of the review. Thus, we evaluated the adequately designed studies that identified biomarkers without diagnostic value, as they provide information that is likely to focus future research on other more clinically useful biomarkers.This methodology also identified biomarkers that were associated with endometriosis in some but not other studies. We did not include evaluations of screening or predictive accuracy tests in this review. We considered the diagnostic performance of an index test to be high when the test reached the criteria for a replacement test (sensitivity of equal or greater than 0.94 with specificity of equal or greater than 0.79) or triage test (sensitivity of equal or greater than 0.95 with specificity of equal or greater than 0.50 or vice versa) or approached these criteria (diagnostic estimates within 0.05 of the set thresholds). We considered all other diagnostic estimates to be low.",
        "Target conditions": "Pelvic endometriosis, defined as endometrial tissue located in the pelvic cavity: involving any of the pelvic organs, peritoneum and pouch of Douglas (POD). Three types of pelvic endometriosis were assessed. Peritoneal endometriosis, defined as endometrial deposits detected on the peritoneum covering pelvic organs, pelvic side walls or POD.    Ovarian endometriosis (endometrioma), defined as an ovarian cyst lined by endometrial tissue, appearing as an ovarian mass of varying size.    Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), defined as subperitoneal infiltration of endometrial implants, i.e. when the endometriotic implants penetrate the retroperitoneal space at a distance of 5 mm or more (Koninckx 1991). DIE may be present in multiple locations, involving either the anterior or posterior pelvic compartments, or both. Peritoneal endometriosis, defined as endometrial deposits detected on the peritoneum covering pelvic organs, pelvic side walls or POD. Ovarian endometriosis (endometrioma), defined as an ovarian cyst lined by endometrial tissue, appearing as an ovarian mass of varying size. Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), defined as subperitoneal infiltration of endometrial implants, i.e. when the endometriotic implants penetrate the retroperitoneal space at a distance of 5 mm or more (Koninckx 1991). DIE may be present in multiple locations, involving either the anterior or posterior pelvic compartments, or both. We did not include certain rare types of endometriosis such as extrapelvic, bladder and ureteric endometriosis because the majority were reported in case reports or case series, and laparoscopy or laparotomy are not reliable reference standards for these conditions. We excluded the studies where diagnosis of endometriosis was not the primary outcome (e.g. malignant versus benign masses or normal versus abnormal pelvis) and the separate data for endometriosis were not available. We also excluded the studies where the findings of the index test formed the basis of selection for the reference standard, because this was likely to distort an assessment of the diagnostic value of the index test. We did include studies that recruited selected populations of women with endometriosis (i.e. those with specific rASRM stages), because there is a poor correlation between the rASRM classification and infertility or pain symptoms. Exclusion of these studies could result in a loss of potentially important diagnostic information from otherwise eligible publications. Where possible, the impact of these studies was addressed in the assessments of heterogeneity. When a study analysed a large population with a wide spectrum of endometriosis and additionally reported a subgroup analysis of the different stages of disease severity, we only considered estimates for the entire population. This is because a subgroup analysis would not directly address the review question regarding the clinical utility of the biomarker in disease detection.",
        "Reference standards": "The reference standard was visualisation of endometriosis at surgery (laparoscopy or laparotomy) with or without histological confirmation, as this is currently the best available test for endometriosis. Information regarding the inter\u2010 and intra\u2010observer correlation of the reference standard was reviewed if reported. We only included studies in which the reference test was performed within 12 months of the sample collection or imaging test, on the assumption that the disease status could change within a period of one year or longer, either naturally or as a result of treatment. We excluded studies in which the participants did not undergo the reference standard or where the findings of the index test formed the basis of selection for undertaking the reference standard, as this was likely to distort an assessment of the diagnostic value of the index test.
