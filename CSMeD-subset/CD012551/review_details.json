    "title": "Non\u2010pharmacological interventions for treating chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome",
    "abstract": "Background Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a common disorder in which the two main clinical features are pelvic pain and lower urinary tract symptoms. There are currently many approaches for its management, using both pharmacological and non\u2010pharmacological interventions. The National Institute of Health \u2010 Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH\u2010CPSI) score is a validated measure commonly used to measure CP/CPPS symptoms.    Objectives To assess the effects of non\u2010pharmacological therapies for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS).    Search methods We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases, trial registries, grey literature and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status. The date of the latest search of all databases was August 2017.    Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials. Inclusion criteria were men with a diagnosis of CP/CPPS. We included all available non\u2010pharmacological interventions.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies, performed statistical analyses and rated quality of evidence (QoE) according to the GRADE methods.    Main results We included 38 unique studies with 3290 men with CP/CPPS across 23 comparisons. 1. Acupuncture: (three studies, 204 participants) based on short\u2010term follow\u2010up, acupuncture probably leads to clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with sham procedure (mean difference (MD) in total NIH\u2010CPSI score \u20105.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u20107.32 to \u20104.26, high QoE). Acupuncture may result in little to no difference in adverse events (low QoE). Acupuncture may not reduce sexual dysfunction when compared with sham procedure (MD in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Scale \u20100.50, 95% CI \u20103.46 to 2.46, low QoE). Acupuncture may also lead to a clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with standard medical therapy (MD \u20106.05, 95% CI \u20107.87 to \u20104.24, two studies, 78 participants, low QoE). We found no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety.  2. Lifestyle modifications: (one study, 100 participants) based on short\u2010term follow\u2010up, lifestyle modifications may be associated with a reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (risk ratio (RR) for improvement in NIH\u2010CPSI scores 3.90, 95% CI 2.20 to 6.92, very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety.  3. Physical activity: (one study, 85 participants) based on short\u2010term follow\u2010up, a physical activity programme may cause a small reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH\u2010CPSI score MD \u20102.50, 95% CI \u20104.69 to \u20100.31, low QoE). This programme may not reduce anxiety or depression (low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction or quality of life.  4. Prostatic massage: (two studies, 115 participants) based on short\u2010term follow\u2010up, we are uncertain whether the prostatic massage reduces or increases prostatitis symptoms compared with control (very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety.  5. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy: (three studies, 157 participants) based on short\u2010term follow\u2010up, extracorporeal shockwave therapy reduces prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH\u2010CPSI score MD \u20106.18, 95% CI \u20107.46 to \u20104.89, high QoE). These results may not be sustained at medium\u2010term follow\u2010up (low QoE). This treatment may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse events (low QoE). This treatment probably improves sexual dysfunction (MD in the IIEF Scale MD 3.34, 95% CI 2.68 to 4.00, one study, 60 participants, moderate QoE). We found no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety.  6. Transrectal thermotherapy compared to medical therapy: (two studies, 237 participants) based on short\u2010term follow\u2010up, transrectal thermotherapy alone or in combination with medical therapy may decrease prostatitis symptoms slightly when compared with medical therapy alone (NIH\u2010CPSI score MD \u20102.50, 95% CI \u20103.82 to \u20101.18, low QoE). One included study reported that participants may experience transient adverse events. We found no information regarding sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety.  7. Other interventions: there is uncertainty about the effects of most of the other interventions included in this review. We found no information regarding psychological support or prostatic surgery.    Authors' conclusions Based on the findings of moderate quality evidence, this review found that some non\u2010pharmacological interventions such as acupuncture and extracorporeal shockwave therapy are likely to result in a decrease in prostatitis symptoms and may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse event. The QoE for most other comparisons was predominantly low. Future clinical trials should include a full report of their methods including adequate masking, consistent assessment of all patient\u2010important outcomes including potential treatment\u2010related adverse events and appropriate sample sizes.",

We used clinically important difference for the review outcomes to rate overall quality of the evidence in 'Summary of finding' tables (Johnston 2010). When the mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) was equal to or larger than the minimal clinically important difference (MCID), we assumed that many participants may have gained clinically meaningful improvement from treatment; when the MD was at least half of the MCID but less than the MCID, an appreciable number of participants had likely achieved a clinically meaningful improvement; and when the MD was less than one\u2010half of the MCID, it was unlikely that an appreciable number of participants achieved clinically meaningful improvement (Johnston 2010). Measured by the National Institutes of Health \u2010 Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH\u2010CPSI) as total score and subscore measurements, when possible, and other validated scales.    We considered an MCID in NIH\u2010CPSI score as a 25% decrease or a 6\u2010point reduction from baseline (Nickel 2003b). This threshold was used to measure the 'responders rate' (Cates 2015).

Defined as treatment intolerance, adverse effects of the interventions at any time after participants were randomised to intervention/comparator groups.    There was no established threshold for adverse events. We considered the clinically important differences of adverse events above as relative risk reduction of at least 25% (Guyatt 2011a).

There was no established threshold for adverse events. We considered the clinically important differences of adverse events above as relative risk reduction of at least 25% (Guyatt 2011a). Measured by validated scales (e.g. International Index of Erectile Function, IIEF).   We considered the MCID in the erectile function domain score of the IIEF of four (Rosen 2011). We planned to use different thresholds of MCID based on the severity of erectile dysfunction, with a threshold of two for men with mild erectile dysfunction, five with moderate erectile dysfunction and seven with severe erectile dysfunction (Rosen 2011). We also considered IIEF\u20105 of over five points as the MCID (Spaliviero 2010). Measured by validated scales (e.g. International Index of Erectile Function, IIEF).

We also considered IIEF\u20105 of over five points as the MCID (Spaliviero 2010). Measured by IPSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) or AUASS (American Urological Association Symptom Score).    We considered improvement of the IPSS score of three points as an MCID to assess efficacy and comparative effectiveness (Barry 1995). We planned to use different thresholds of MCID based on the severity of IPSS, with a threshold of three for men with mild LUTS, five for moderate LUTS and eight for severe LUTS (Barry 1995).

Assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 12 (SF\u201012) or other validated scales.
