    "abstract": "Background Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynaecological cancer in developed countries. Surgery and chemotherapy are considered its mainstay of treatment and the completeness of surgery is a major prognostic factor for survival in these women. Currently, computed tomography (CT) is used to preoperatively assess tumour resectability. If considered feasible, women will be scheduled for primary debulking surgery (i.e. surgical efforts to remove the bulk of tumour with the aim of leaving no visible (macroscopic) tumour). If primary debulking is not considered feasible (i.e. the tumour load is too extensive), women will receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy to reduce tumour load and subsequently undergo (interval) surgery. However, CT is imperfect in assessing tumour resectability, so additional imaging modalities can be considered to optimise treatment selection.    Objectives To assess the diagnostic accuracy of fluorodeoxyglucose\u201018 (FDG) PET/CT, conventional and diffusion\u2010weighted (DW) MRI as replacement or add\u2010on to abdominal CT, for assessing tumour resectability at primary debulking surgery in women with stage III to IV epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer.    Search methods We searched MEDLINE and Embase (OVID) for potential eligible studies (1946 to 23 February 2017). Additionally, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO\u2010ICTRP and the reference list of all relevant studies were searched.    Selection criteria Diagnostic accuracy studies addressing the accuracy of preoperative FDG\u2010PET/CT, conventional or DW\u2010MRI on assessing tumour resectability in women with advanced stage (III to IV) epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer who are scheduled to undergo primary debulking surgery.    Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance and inclusion, extracted data and performed methodological quality assessment using QUADAS\u20102. The limited number of studies did not permit meta\u2010analyses.    Main results Five studies (544 participants) were included in the analysis. All studies performed the index test as replacement of abdominal CT. Two studies (366 participants) addressed the accuracy of FDG\u2010PET/CT for assessing incomplete debulking with residual disease of any size (> 0 cm) with sensitivities of 1.0 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.0) and 0.66 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.73) and specificities of 1.0 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.0) and 0.88 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.93), respectively (low\u2010 and moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Three studies (178 participants) investigated MRI for different target conditions, of which two investigated DW\u2010MRI and one conventional MRI. The first study showed that DW\u2010MRI determines incomplete debulking with residual disease of any size with a sensitivity of 0.94 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.99) and a specificity of 0.98 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.00) (low\u2010 and moderate\u2010certainty evidence). For abdominal CT, the sensitivity for assessing incomplete debulking was 0.66 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.78) and the specificity 0.77 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.87) (low\u2010 and low\u2010certainty evidence). The second study reported a sensitivity of DW\u2010MRI of 0.75 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.97) and a specificity of 0.96 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.00) (very low\u2010certainty evidence) for assessing incomplete debulking with residual disease > 1 cm. In the last study, the sensitivity for assessing incomplete debulking with residual disease of > 2 cm on conventional MRI was 0.91 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.00) and the specificity 0.97 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.00) (very low\u2010certainty evidence). Overall, the certainty of evidence was very low to moderate (according to GRADE), mainly due to small sample sizes and imprecision.    Authors' conclusions Studies suggested a high specificity and moderate sensitivity for FDG\u2010PET/CT and MRI to assess macroscopic incomplete debulking. However, the certainty of the evidence was insufficient to advise routine addition of FDG\u2010PET/CT or MRI to clinical practice..  In a research setting, adding an alternative imaging method could be considered for women identified as suitable for primary debulking by abdominal CT, in an attempt to filter out false\u2010negatives (i.e. debulking, feasible based on abdominal CT, unfeasible at actual surgery).",

        "Types of studies": "We included randomised comparisons of diagnostic tests, cross\u2010sectional, retrospective and prospective cohort studies, that address the DTA of preoperative PET(\u2010CT), conventional or (additional) diffusion\u2010weighted MRI on assessing tumour resectability in women who are scheduled to undergo primary debulking surgery. Studies which added the index test(s) on to abdominal CT or when the index test replaced abdominal CT, were included. To evaluate the add\u2010on effect, the alternative imaging test had to be performed within four weeks before or after the abdominal CT. Studies following a case\u2010control design, which carry an inherent high risk of bias in a DTA research objective, were excluded.",
        "Participants": "Studies had to include adult (18 years of age or more) women diagnosed with advanced stage (stage III to IV) epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer, considered eligible for primary debulking surgery (i.e. no adjuvant chemotherapy treatment or prior surgery to assess tumour extension was performed). Also, studies with participants in stage I to IV disease were included if data from women with stage III to IV disease could be extracted.",
        "Index tests": "The index tests of interest were preoperatively performed fluorodeoxyglucose\u201018 PET(\u2010CT), conventional and diffusion\u2010weighted MRI (see; Index test(s)). All these imaging modalities were used as a replacement or as an add\u2010on to abdominal CT in women with advanced epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer. A positive index test was defined as an assessment of tumour spread in which resection at primary debulking surgery was judged to be unfeasible (i.e. index test indicates \u2018tumour is not resectable\u2019) by the radiologist or multidisciplinary tumour board. Conversely, a negative index test was defined as a tumour for which resection by primary debulking surgery was considered feasible.",
        "Target conditions": "The target condition was defined as the resectability of all deposits from epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer at primary debulking surgery. This target condition had three categories (see; Target condition being diagnosed) which makes two commonly studied and clinically relevant dichotomisations possible (see: Statistical analysis and data synthesis).",
        "Reference standards": "The reference standard was the process of debulking surgery. This is most commonly performed via a laparotomy, although in recent years laparoscopy has also been performed in cases of limited disease volume. During such a procedure, the abdomen is systematically explored to assess the tumour spread and its resectability. The outcome category (size of residual tumour after surgery) was determined by the surgeon at the end of this surgery."

Were the index test results interpreted without the knowledge of the results of the reference standard?    This will always be rated as 'yes', because the index test is performed before the reference standard.    1. Were the same clinical data available when test results were interpreted as would be available when the test is used in clinical practice?    'Yes' if all usual clinical data (except laparotomy results) were available when the index test was interpreted, including details of physical examination, serum tumour markers, ultrasound, and CT/MRI imaging.

'Unclear' if insufficient information was reported.      2.Was the threshold used prespecified?   'Yes' if a clear description of the threshold was given which was specified before start of the study.  'No' if no clear description was given beforehand. 'Unclear' if there was insufficient information within the paper to determine whether or not a prespecified threshold was used.    2. Did the study provide a clear definition of what was considered to be a \u2019positive\u2019 result for the index test?    'Yes' if a clear description was given about when the index test was positive or negative (e.g. what the cut\u2010off for too extensive abdominal disease was).  'No' if there was no clear description given about what was classified as too extensive disease or not.  'Unclear' if there was insufficient information within the paper to determine whether or not a defined threshold was used for a positive test result.       3.

(High/low/unclear)   Were there concerns that the target condition as defined by the reference standard did not match the question? (High/low/unclear)       1. Was the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition?   'Yes' if the reference standard was laparotomy. 'No' if the reference standard used was not the one defined in the protocol. 'Unclear' if the information was insufficient.   1. Did the study provide a clear definition of what was considered to be a \u2019positive\u2019 result for the reference standard?    'Yes' if a clear description was given about when the reference standard was positive or negative (e.g. if description was given about the size of the tumour deposits left after surgery).  'No' if there was no clear description of tumour deposit size after surgery. 'Unclear' if there was insufficient information within the paper that described tumour size after surgery.       2. Were the reference standard results interpreted without the knowledge of the results of the index test?    'Yes' if the report stated that the reference test was performed by individuals who did not perform the  index test. 'No' if the reference test was done by the same person performing the index test. 'Unclear' if not reported.        3. Was the surgeon's expertise adequate to perform the reference standard?   'Yes' if the reference test was performed by a gynaecological oncologist. 'No' if the reference test was not performed by a gynaecological oncologist. 'Unclear' if not reported.       Domain 4  Flow and Timing    Could the patient flow have introduced bias? (High/low/unclear)        1. Was the time period between reference standard and index test short enough to be reasonably sure that the target condition did not change between the two tests?    'Yes' if the time period between the index test and reference standard did not extend 6 weeks.  'No' if the time period was more than 6 weeks for an unacceptably high proportion of patients.  'Unclear' if the information on the timing of tests was not provided.        2. Did all patients receive the same reference standard?   'Yes' if all patients underwent the reference standard (laparotomy, diagnostic laparoscopy or image\u2010guided biopsy of distant metastases).  'No' if not all patients underwent the reference standard. 'Unclear' if insufficient information was provided.       3. Were all patients included in the analysis?   'Yes' if for all patients entered in the study were included in the analysis. 'No' if not all the patients in the study were included in the analysis.
