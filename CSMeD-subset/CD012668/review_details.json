    "title": "Yoga for treating urinary incontinence in women",
    "abstract": "Background Urinary incontinence in women is associated with poor quality of life and difficulties in social, psychological and sexual functioning. The condition may affect up to 15% of middle\u2010aged or older women in the general population. Conservative treatments such as lifestyle interventions, bladder training and pelvic floor muscle training (used either alone or in combination with other interventions) are the initial approaches to the management of urinary incontinence. Many women are interested in additional treatments such as yoga, a system of philosophy, lifestyle and physical practice that originated in ancient India.    Objectives To assess the effects of yoga for treating urinary incontinence in women.   Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence and Cochrane Complementary Medicine Specialised Registers. We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify any ongoing or unpublished studies. We handsearched Proceedings of the International Congress on Complementary Medicine Research and the European Congress for Integrative Medicine. We searched the NHS Economic Evaluation Database for economic studies, and supplemented this search with searches for economics studies in MEDLINE and Embase from 2015 onwards. Database searches are up\u2010to\u2010date as of 21 June 2018.    Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials in women diagnosed with urinary incontinence in which one group was allocated to treatment with yoga.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts of all retrieved articles, selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and evaluated the certainty of the evidence for each reported outcome. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus. We planned to combine clinically comparable studies in Review Manager 5 using random\u2010effects meta\u2010analysis and to carry out sensitivity and subgroup analyses. We planned to create a table listing economic studies on yoga for incontinence but not carry out any analyses on these studies.    Main results We included two studies (involving a total of 49 women). Each study compared yoga to a different comparator, therefore we were unable to combine the data in a meta\u2010analysis. A third study that has been completed but not yet fully reported is awaiting assessment.  One included study was a six\u2010week study comparing yoga to a waiting list in 19 women with either urgency urinary incontinence or stress urinary incontinence. We judged the certainty of the evidence for all reported outcomes as very low due to performance bias, detection bias, and imprecision. The number of women reporting cure was not reported. We are uncertain whether yoga results in satisfaction with cure or improvement of incontinence (risk ratio (RR) 6.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44 to 27.88; an increase of 592 from 111 per 1000, 95% CI 160 to 1000). We are uncertain whether there is a difference between yoga and waiting list in condition\u2010specific quality of life as measured on the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form (mean difference (MD) 1.74, 95% CI \u201033.02 to 36.50); the number of micturitions (MD \u20100.77, 95% CI \u20102.13 to 0.59); the number of incontinence episodes (MD \u20101.57, 95% CI \u20102.83 to \u20100.31); or the bothersomeness of incontinence as measured on the Urogenital Distress Inventory 6 (MD \u20100.90, 95% CI \u20101.46 to \u20100.34). There was no evidence of a difference in the number of women who experienced at least one adverse event (risk difference 0%, 95% CI \u201038% to 38%; no difference from 222 per 1000, 95% CI 380 fewer to 380 more).  The second included study was an eight\u2010week study in 30 women with urgency urinary incontinence that compared mindfulness\u2010based stress reduction (MBSR) to an active control intervention of yoga classes. The study was unblinded, and there was high attrition from both study arms for all outcome assessments. We judged the certainty of the evidence for all reported outcomes as very low due to performance bias, attrition bias, imprecision and indirectness. The number of women reporting cure was not reported. We are uncertain whether women in the yoga group were less likely to report improvement in incontinence at eight weeks compared to women in the MBSR group (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.43; a decrease of 419 from 461 per 1000, 95% CI 5 to 660). We are uncertain about the effect of MBSR compared to yoga on reports of cure or improvement in incontinence, improvement in condition\u2010specific quality of life measured on the Overactive Bladder Health\u2010Related Quality of Life Scale, reduction in incontinence episodes or reduction in bothersomeness of incontinence as measured on the Overactive Bladder Symptom and Quality of Life\u2010Short Form at eight weeks. The study did not report on adverse effects.    Authors' conclusions We identified few trials on yoga for incontinence, and the existing trials were small and at high risk of bias. In addition, we did not find any studies of economic outcomes related to yoga for urinary incontinence. Due to the lack of evidence to answer the review question, we are uncertain whether yoga is useful for women with urinary incontinence. Additional, well\u2010conducted trials with larger sample sizes are needed.",

        "Types of studies": "We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and the first period of cross\u2010over RCTs. We excluded quasi\u2010randomised controlled trials (i.e. trials in which assignment to treatment was made using a non\u2010random method such as alternation) because the method of allocation may lead to biased estimates of effect. We did not restrict study eligibility by language or publication status. We only included health economic studies conducted alongside studies that were included in the clinical component of this systematic review (Shemilt 2011).",
        "Types of participants": "We included studies with women aged 18 years or more who were diagnosed as having urinary incontinence on the basis of symptoms, signs or urodynamic evaluation (as defined by the trial authors). We only included trials that recruited both men and women if at least 90% of participants were women or if the trial provided demographic and outcome data separately for women. We included trials with women diagnosed as having stress, urgency or mixed urinary incontinence, as well as trials with participants who had mixed or unclassified types of urinary incontinence. We included trials carried out on women who were experiencing urinary incontinence during the antenatal or postnatal period. Because this group has physiological differences from women who are not pregnant or postpartum, and the natural history of incontinence in this population differs from that in non\u2010pregnant women, the observed effects of the intervention may differ in this group. We therefore did not group this population with women who were not pregnant or postpartum and we planned to analyse the studies separately throughout the review. We excluded studies of women who had urinary incontinence thought to be due to factors beyond the urinary tract such as neurological or psychiatric disorders, cognitive impairment, or mobility problems. We also excluded studies that focused on women who were experiencing nocturnal enuresis.",
        "Types of interventions": "We included studies of yoga as a treatment for urinary incontinence, where the study report specified that the intervention was 'yoga' provided at any dose, with any frequency and for any duration, because we believe these factors are likely to vary in practice. We included interventions that belonged to any yoga tradition but excluded studies in which the yoga intervention did not include a physical practice component. We included studies that compared yoga to no treatment or to another active treatment. We also included studies that compared yoga as an adjunct to other treatments versus those same treatments without yoga. The types of included comparisons were as follows. Yoga versus no specific active intervention (e.g. usual care, waiting list).   Yoga versus an active intervention (e.g. lifestyle intervention or pelvic floor muscle training), for which we considered different active comparators separately (e.g. yoga versus lifestyle advice, yoga versus pelvic floor muscle training).    Yoga plus an intervention versus the same intervention without yoga (e.g. yoga as an add\u2010on intervention to pelvic floor training versus pelvic floor training alone), for which we considered different interventions separately. Yoga versus no specific active intervention (e.g. usual care, waiting list). Yoga versus an active intervention (e.g. lifestyle intervention or pelvic floor muscle training), for which we considered different active comparators separately (e.g. yoga versus lifestyle advice, yoga versus pelvic floor muscle training). Yoga plus an intervention versus the same intervention without yoga (e.g. yoga as an add\u2010on intervention to pelvic floor training versus pelvic floor training alone), for which we considered different interventions separately. We included studies in which co\u2010interventions were provided if they were similar between intervention groups (e.g. both the yoga and the comparison groups received advice on behavioural management techniques). Studies that compare yoga to a sham yoga intervention do not appear to be common (Park 2014). However, we planned that we would consider such studies to represent an additional type of comparison (i.e. yoga versus sham yoga) and would analyse them separately. We excluded studies of interventions based on yoga (e.g. exercises based on yoga postures) but not characterised as yoga, as well as studies of multimodal interventions in which yoga is only one component amongst others, such as mindfulness\u2010based stress reduction (MBSR).",
        "Types of outcome measures": "We used outcomes suggested by the Standardisation Committee of the International Continence Society (B\u00f8 2017; Haylen 2010). The following five categories of outcomes are recommended for research investigating the effect of therapeutic interventions for women with urinary incontinence (Lose 2001): The woman\u2019s observations (e.g. symptoms);   Quantification of the woman's symptoms (e.g. urine loss);   The clinician\u2019s observations (anatomical and functional signs);   The woman's quality of life (urinary incontinence \u2010 specific and general);   Economic measures. The woman\u2019s observations (e.g. symptoms); Quantification of the woman's symptoms (e.g. urine loss); The clinician\u2019s observations (anatomical and functional signs); The woman's quality of life (urinary incontinence \u2010 specific and general); Economic measures. In this review, we considered at least one outcome from each of the first four categories. We included specific outcomes that are commonly found in other Cochrane Incontinence reviews for urinary incontinence in women so that this review may produce results that are easily compared to or combined with those of other reviews of treatment for the same condition. Number of women who report they are cured (they no longer experience urinary incontinence).   Number of women who report cure or improvement of urinary incontinence.   Urinary incontinence condition\u2010 or symptom\u2010specific quality of life, as measured by any relevant scale (e.g. the Urinary Incontinence Quality of Life scale (Patrick 1999), the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (Uebersax 1995), the International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Quality of Life (ICIQ\u2010LUTSqol) (Nystrom 2015), or the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI) and the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ) (Barber 2001)). Number of women who report they are cured (they no longer experience urinary incontinence). Number of women who report cure or improvement of urinary incontinence. Urinary incontinence condition\u2010 or symptom\u2010specific quality of life, as measured by any relevant scale (e.g. the Urinary Incontinence Quality of Life scale (Patrick 1999), the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (Uebersax 1995), the International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Quality of Life (ICIQ\u2010LUTSqol) (Nystrom 2015), or the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI) and the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ) (Barber 2001)). Quantification of symptoms   Number of micturitions (daily).   Number of episodes of incontinence (daily).   Urine loss as measured with a pad or paper towel weight test (either the short\u2010 or long\u2010term test).    Symptoms as reported by study participants on any condition\u2010specific scale (e.g. the Severity Index for Urinary Incontinence in Women (Sandvik 1993)).      Clinician's observations (anatomical and functional signs)   Clinical assessment of presence of incontinence, such as urine leakage during a cough test.    Measurement of pelvic floor muscle function, such as by electromyography, vaginal squeeze pressure, pelvic floor muscle force, and morphological measurements (dynamometry, ultrasound).      Quality of life   Quality of life measured on a scale that is not condition\u2010 or symptom\u2010specific (e.g. the 36\u2010Item Short Form Health Survey (SF\u201036)).    Depression, anxiety or distress as measured on relevant scales (e.g. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)).    Other measures of emotional and social impact of the disorder such as the bothersomeness of the condition, the social impact of the condition and sexual functioning.      Adverse effects   Number of adverse effects (e.g. pain, discomfort). Quantification of symptoms Number of micturitions (daily). Number of episodes of incontinence (daily). Urine loss as measured with a pad or paper towel weight test (either the short\u2010 or long\u2010term test). Symptoms as reported by study participants on any condition\u2010specific scale (e.g. the Severity Index for Urinary Incontinence in Women (Sandvik 1993)). Clinician's observations (anatomical and functional signs) Clinical assessment of presence of incontinence, such as urine leakage during a cough test.

Depression, anxiety or distress as measured on relevant scales (e.g. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)). Other measures of emotional and social impact of the disorder such as the bothersomeness of the condition, the social impact of the condition and sexual functioning. Adverse effects Number of adverse effects (e.g. pain, discomfort). The GRADE working group recommends including up to seven critical outcomes in a systematic review (Guyatt 2011a; Guyatt 2011b). We therefore considered the following outcomes for assessing the certainty of the evidence: Number of women who report they are cured (they no longer experience urinary incontinence);   Number of women who report cure or improvement of urinary incontinence;   Urinary incontinence condition\u2010specific or symptom\u2010specific quality of life;   Number of micturitions (daily);   Number of episodes of incontinence (daily);   Adverse effects.

We grouped all outcomes into three time points: short\u2010term (closest to three months after randomisation), intermediate\u2010term (closest to six months after randomisation) and long\u2010term (closest to one year after randomisation). When an included trial presented multiple time points, we considered the short\u2010term time point as primary and other time points as secondary.",
