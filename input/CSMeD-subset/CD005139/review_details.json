    "title": "Anti\u2010vascular endothelial growth factor for neovascular age\u2010related macular degeneration",
    "abstract": "Background Age\u2010related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of uncorrectable severe vision loss in people aged 55 years and older in the developed world. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to AMD accounts for most cases of AMD\u2010related severe vision loss. Intravitreous injection of anti\u2010vascular endothelial growth factor (anti\u2010VEGF) agents aims to block the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the eye to prevent vision loss and, in some instances, to improve vision.    Objectives \u2022 To investigate ocular and systemic effects of, and quality of life associated with, intravitreous injection of three anti\u2010VEGF agents (pegaptanib, ranibizumab, and bevacizumab) versus no anti\u2010VEGF treatment for patients with neovascular AMD  \u2022 To compare the relative effects of one of these anti\u2010VEGF agents versus another when administered in comparable dosages and regimens    Search methods To identify eligible studies for this review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register (searched January 31, 2018); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to January 31, 2018); Embase Ovid (1947 to January 31, 2018); the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to January 31, 2018); the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) Registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch \u2010 searched January 31, 2018); ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov \u2010 searched November 28, 2018); and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en \u2010 searched January 31, 2018). We did not impose any date or language restrictions in electronic searches for trials.    Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated pegaptanib, ranibizumab, or bevacizumab versus each other or versus a control treatment (e.g. sham treatment, photodynamic therapy), in which participants were followed for at least one year.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened records, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional data. We compared outcomes using risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences (MDs). We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.    Main results We included 16 RCTs that had enrolled a total of 6347 participants with neovascular AMD (the number of participants per trial ranged from 23 to 1208) and identified one potentially relevant ongoing trial. Six trials compared anti\u2010VEGF treatment (pegaptanib, ranibizumab, or bevacizumab) versus control, and 10 trials compared bevacizumab versus ranibizumab. Pharmaceutical companies conducted or sponsored four trials but funded none of the studies that evaluated bevacizumab. Researchers conducted these trials at various centers across five continents (North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia). The overall certainty of the evidence was moderate to high, and most trials had an overall low risk of bias. All but one trial had been registered prospectively.  When compared with those who received control treatment, more participants who received intravitreous injection of any of the three anti\u2010VEGF agents had gained 15 letters or more of visual acuity (risk ratio [RR] 4.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.32 to 7.55; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), had lost fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.55; high\u2010certainty evidence), and showed mean improvement in visual acuity (mean difference 6.7 letters, 95% CI 4.4 to 9.0 in one pegaptanib trial; mean difference 17.8 letters, 95% CI 16.0 to 19.7 in three ranibizumab trials; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) after one year of follow\u2010up. Participants treated with anti\u2010VEGF agents showed improvement in morphologic outcomes (e.g. size of CNV, central retinal thickness) compared with participants not treated with anti\u2010VEGF agents (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). No trial directly compared pegaptanib versus another anti\u2010VEGF agent and followed participants for one year; however, when compared with control treatments, ranibizumab and bevacizumab each yielded larger improvements in visual acuity outcomes than pegaptanib.  Visual acuity outcomes after bevacizumab and ranibizumab were similar when the same RCTs compared the same regimens with respect to gain of 15 or more letters of visual acuity (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.12; high\u2010certainty evidence) and loss of fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.02; high\u2010certainty evidence); results showed similar mean improvement in visual acuity (mean difference [MD] \u20100.5 letters, 95% CI \u20101.5 to 0.5; high\u2010certainty evidence) after one year of follow\u2010up, despite the substantially lower cost of bevacizumab compared with ranibizumab. Reduction in central retinal thickness was less among bevacizumab\u2010treated participants than among ranibizumab\u2010treated participants after one year (MD \u201011.6 \u03bcm, 95% CI \u201021.6 to \u20101.7; high\u2010certainty evidence); however, this difference is within the range of measurement error, and we did not interpret it to be clinically meaningful.  Ocular inflammation and increased intraocular pressure (IOP) after intravitreal injection were the most frequently reported serious ocular adverse events. Researchers reported endophthalmitis in less than 1% of anti\u2010VEGF\u2010treated participants and in no cases among control groups. The occurrence of serious systemic adverse events was comparable across anti\u2010VEGF\u2010treated groups and control groups; however, the numbers of events and trial participants may have been insufficient to show a meaningful difference between groups (evidence of low\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty). Investigators rarely measured and reported data on visual function, quality of life, or economic outcomes.    Authors' conclusions Results of this review show the effectiveness of anti\u2010VEGF agents (pegaptanib, ranibizumab, and bevacizumab) in terms of maintaining visual acuity; studies show that ranibizumab and bevacizumab improved visual acuity in some eyes that received these agents and were equally effective. Available information on the adverse effects of each medication does not suggest a higher incidence of potentially vision\u2010threatening complications with intravitreous injection of anti\u2010VEGF agents compared with control interventions; however, clinical trial sample sizes were not sufficient to estimate differences in rare safety outcomes. Future Cochrane Reviews should incorporate research evaluating variable dosing regimens of anti\u2010VEGF agents, effects of long\u2010term use, use of combination therapies (e.g. anti\u2010VEGF treatment plus photodynamic therapy), and other methods of delivering these agents.",
