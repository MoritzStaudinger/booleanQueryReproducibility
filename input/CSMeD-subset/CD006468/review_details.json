    "abstract": "Background Central venous catheter (CVC) placement increases the risk of thrombosis in people with cancer. Thrombosis often necessitates the removal of the CVC, resulting in treatment delays and thrombosis\u2010related morbidity and mortality. This is an update of the Cochrane Review published in 2014.    Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in people with cancer with a CVC.    Search methods We conducted a comprehensive literature search in May 2018 that included a major electronic search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), and Embase (Ovid); handsearching of conference proceedings; checking of references of included studies; searching for ongoing studies; and using the 'related citation' feature in PubMed. This update of the systematic review was based on the findings of a literature search conducted on 14 May 2018.    Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the benefits and harms of unfractionated heparin (UFH), low\u2010molecular\u2010weight heparin (LMWH), vitamin K antagonists (VKA), or fondaparinux or comparing the effects of two of these anticoagulants in people with cancer and a CVC.    Data collection and analysis Using a standardized form, we extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Outcomes included all\u2010cause mortality, symptomatic catheter\u2010related venous thromboembolism (VTE), pulmonary embolism (PE), major bleeding, minor bleeding, catheter\u2010related infection, thrombocytopenia, and health\u2010related quality of life (HRQoL). We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach (Balshem 2011).    Main results Thirteen RCTs (23 papers) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. These trials enrolled 3420 participants. Seven RCTs compared LMWH to no LMWH (six in adults and one in children), six RCTs compared VKA to no VKA (five in adults and one in children), and three RCTs compared LMWH to VKA in adults.  LMWH versus no LMWH Six RCTs (1537 participants) compared LMWH to no LMWH in adults. The meta\u2010analyses showed that LMWH probably decreased the incidence of symptomatic catheter\u2010related VTE up to three months of follow\u2010up compared to no LMWH (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.81; risk difference (RD) 38 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 13 fewer to 52 fewer; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). However, the analysis did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of LMWH on mortality at three months of follow\u2010up (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.26; RD 14 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 36 fewer to 20 more; low\u2010certainty evidence), major bleeding (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.06 to 36.28; RD 0 more per 1000, 95% CI 1 fewer to 35 more; very low\u2010certainty evidence), minor bleeding (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.92; RD 14 more per 1000, 95% CI 16 fewer to 79 more; low\u2010certainty evidence), and thrombocytopenia (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.33; RD 5 more per 1000, 95% CI 35 fewer to 58 more; low\u2010certainty evidence).  VKA versus no VKA Five RCTs (1599 participants) compared low\u2010dose VKA to no VKA in adults. The meta\u2010analyses did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of low\u2010dose VKA compared to no VKA on mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.55; RD 1 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 34 fewer to 52 more; low\u2010certainty evidence), symptomatic catheter\u2010related VTE (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.64; RD 31 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 62 fewer to 51 more; low\u2010certainty evidence), major bleeding (RR 7.14, 95% CI 0.88 to 57.78; RD 12 more per 1000, 95% CI 0 fewer to 110 more; low\u2010certainty evidence), minor bleeding (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.26; RD 15 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 30 fewer to 13 more; low\u2010certainty evidence), premature catheter removal (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.24; RD 29 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 114 fewer to 202 more; low\u2010certainty evidence), and catheter\u2010related infection (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.85; RD 71 more per 1000, 95% CI 109 fewer to 356; low\u2010certainty evidence).  LMWH versus VKA Three RCTs (641 participants) compared LMWH to VKA in adults. The available evidence did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of LMWH relative to VKA on mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.59; RD 6 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 41 fewer to 56 more; low\u2010certainty evidence), symptomatic catheter\u2010related VTE (RR 1.83, 95% CI 0.44 to 7.61; RD 15 more per 1000, 95% CI 10 fewer to 122 more; very low\u2010certainty evidence), PE (RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.74 to 3.92; RD 35 more per 1000, 95% CI 13 fewer to 144 more; low\u2010certainty evidence), major bleeding (RR 3.11, 95% CI 0.13 to 73.11; RD 2 more per 1000, 95% CI 1 fewer to 72 more; very low\u2010certainty evidence), or minor bleeding (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.61; RD 1 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 21 fewer to 95 more; very low\u2010certainty evidence). The meta\u2010analyses showed that LMWH probably increased the risk of thrombocytopenia compared to VKA at three months of follow\u2010up (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.39; RD 149 more per 1000, 95% CI 43 fewer to 300 more; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).    Authors' conclusions The evidence was not conclusive for the effect of LMWH on mortality, the effect of VKA on mortality and catheter\u2010related VTE, and the effect of LMWH compared to VKA on mortality and catheter\u2010related VTE. We found moderate\u2010certainty evidence that LMWH reduces catheter\u2010related VTE compared to no LMWH. People with cancer with CVCs considering anticoagulation should balance the possible benefit of reduced thromboembolic complications with the possible harms and burden of anticoagulants.",
