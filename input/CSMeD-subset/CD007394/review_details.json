    "title": "Galactomannan detection for invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients",
    "abstract": "Background Invasive aspergillosis is the most common life\u2010threatening opportunistic invasive mycosis in immunocompromised patients. A test for invasive aspergillosis should neither be too invasive nor too great a burden for the already weakened patient. The serum galactomannan enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) seems to have the potential to meet both requirements.    Objectives To obtain summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of galactomannan detection in serum for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.    Search methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science with both MeSH terms and text words for both aspergillosis and the sandwich ELISA. We checked the reference lists of included studies and review articles for additional studies. We conducted the searches in February 2014.    Selection criteria We included cross\u2010sectional studies, case\u2010control designs and consecutive series of patients assessing the diagnostic accuracy of galactomannan detection for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in patients with neutropenia or patients whose neutrophils are functionally compromised. The reference standard was composed of the criteria given by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the Mycoses Study Group (MSG).    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed quality and extracted data. We carried out meta\u2010analysis using the bivariate method. We investigated sources of heterogeneity by adding potential sources of heterogeneity to the model as covariates.    Main results We included 54 studies in the review (50 in the meta\u2010analyses), containing 5660 patients, of whom 586 had proven or probable invasive aspergillosis. When using an optical density index (ODI) of 0.5 as a cut\u2010off value, the sensitivity of the test was 78% (70% to 85%) and the specificity was 85% (78% to 91%). At a cut\u2010off value of 1.0 ODI, the sensitivity was 71% (63% to 78%) and the specificity was 90% (86% to 93%). At a cut\u2010off value of 1.5 ODI, the sensitivity was 63% (49% to 78%) and the specificity was 93% (89% to 97%). None of the potential sources of heterogeneity had a statistically significant effect on either sensitivity or specificity.    Authors' conclusions If we used the test at a cut\u2010off value of 0.5 ODI in a population of 100 patients with a disease prevalence of 11% (overall median prevalence), two patients who have invasive aspergillosis would be missed (sensitivity 78%, 22% false negatives), and 13 patients would be treated unnecessarily or referred unnecessarily for further testing (specificity 85%, 15% false negatives). If we used the test at a cut\u2010off value of 1.5 in the same population, that would mean that four invasive aspergillosis patients would be missed (sensitivity 61%, 39% false negatives), and six patients would be treated or referred for further testing unnecessarily (specificity 93%, 7% false negatives). These numbers should, however, be interpreted with caution because the results were very heterogeneous.",

        "Types of studies": "Studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of galactomannan detection by the Platelia\u00a9 sandwich ELISA test, with either prospective or retrospective data collection, were eligible. The galactomannan ELISA could be assessed alone or in comparison to other tests.",
        "Participants": "Studies had to include patients with neutropenia or patients whose neutrophils are functionally compromised. We included studies with the following patient groups: patients with haematological malignancies, receiving haematopoietic stem cell transplants, chemotherapeutics or immunosuppressive drugs;    solid organ transplant recipients and other patients who are receiving immunosuppressive drugs for a prolonged time;    patients with cancer who are receiving chemotherapeutics;   patients with a medical condition compromising the immune system, such as HIV/AIDS and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD, an inherited abnormality of the neutrophils). patients with haematological malignancies, receiving haematopoietic stem cell transplants, chemotherapeutics or immunosuppressive drugs; solid organ transplant recipients and other patients who are receiving immunosuppressive drugs for a prolonged time; patients with cancer who are receiving chemotherapeutics; patients with a medical condition compromising the immune system, such as HIV/AIDS and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD, an inherited abnormality of the neutrophils).",
        "Index tests": "A commercially available galactomannan sandwich ELISA (Platelia\u00a9) was the test under evaluation. We only included studies concerning galactomannan detection in serum. We excluded studies addressing detection in BAL fluid, a number of other body fluids, such as CSF or peritoneal fluid, and tissue. We also excluded studies evaluating in\u2010house serum galactomannan tests.",
        "Target conditions": "The target condition of this review was invasive aspergillosis, also called invasive pulmonary aspergillosis or systemic aspergillosis.",
        "Reference standards": "The following reference standards can be used to define the target condition: autopsy;   the criteria of the EORTC/MSG (Ascioglu 2002; De Pauw 2008); or    the demonstration of hyphal invasion in biopsies, combined with a positive culture for Aspergillus species from the same specimens. autopsy; the criteria of the EORTC/MSG (Ascioglu 2002; De Pauw 2008); or the demonstration of hyphal invasion in biopsies, combined with a positive culture for Aspergillus species from the same specimens. The gold standard for this diagnosis is autopsy, combined with a positive culture of Aspergillus species from the autopsy specimens, or with histopathological evidence of Aspergillus. Autopsy is rarely reported, therefore we decided to take the criteria of the EORTC/MSG as the reference standard. These criteria divide the patient population into four categories: patients with proven invasive aspergillosis, patients who probably have invasive aspergillosis, patients who possibly have invasive aspergillosis and patients without invasive aspergillosis (seeTable 1). This division is based on host factor criteria, microbiological criteria and clinical criteria. Clinical studies have shown that these criteria do not match autopsy results perfectly. This especially true for the possible category. For clinical trials investigating the effect of treatment, for example, it is recommended that only the proven and probable categories are used (Borlenghi 2007; Subira 2003). The exclusion of patients with 'possible' invasive aspergillosis, which can be regarded as group of 'difficult or atypical' patients, is likely to affect the observed diagnostic accuracy of a test. Also, the exclusion of any other of the reference standard groups may affect the accuracy of the index test. We therefore excluded studies explicitly excluding one of the four categories of patients from the review, as well as studies in which it is not clear how many patients with proven, probable, possible or no invasive aspergillosis had positive or negative index test results."

Is the reference standards likely to correctly classify the target condition? As we regarded the EORTC/MSG criteria as being acceptable, this item was always fulfilled by all included studies. We did, however, register whether the authors of the primary study used the exact criteria of the EORTC/MSG and (if reported) how they were interpreted. If they only mentioned that they did divide their patients into categories, but did not explain on what basis, we scored this item as 'unclear'.    3b. Were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index tests?  YES \u2010 when the authors clearly stated that the assessment of the index test was blinded.

LOW CONCERN \u2010 if the EORTC criteria were used in the same way as described in the reference papers from 2002 and 2008. UNCLEAR CONCERN \u2010 if it was not clear how the EORTC criteria were implemented.     4. Flow and timing domain  4a. Was there an appropriate interval between index test and reference standard? The calculation of the diagnostic accuracy of a test is more reliable when the time between the Platelia test and the final diagnosis is not too long. If the galactomannan test is negative on day 1 and the patient is diagnosed as having IA on day 20, this test result will be regarded as a false negative result. The patient's true status on day 1, however, was not known in this case and the false negative result may have been a true negative result at that moment. We judged a time interval of less than 15 days as appropriate (YES).    4b. Did all patients receive the same reference standard? The reference test was in most studies a composite reference while the index test was often used as screening tool to monitor whether patients developed IA. So some patients fulfilled more criteria than others. However, we considered the EORTC criteria as one reference standard. Partial verification would have been a problem in studies were only autopsy is used as reference standard, because it is only done when a patient dies and his or her family gives permission.    4c. Were all patients included in the analysis? YES \u2010 if all included patients also ended up in the 2 x 2 table. NO \u2010 if there was a discrepancy between these two numbers.
