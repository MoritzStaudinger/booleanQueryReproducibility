    "title": "Human papillomavirus testing versus repeat cytology for triage of minor cytological cervical lesions",
    "abstract": "Background Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and low\u2010grade squamous intra\u2010epithelial lesions (LSIL) are minor lesions of the cervical epithelium, detectable by cytological examination of cells collected from the surface of the cervix of a woman.  Usually, women with ASCUS and LSIL do not have cervical (pre\u2010) cancer, however a substantial proportion of them do have underlying high\u2010grade cervical intra\u2010epithelial neoplasia (CIN, grade 2 or 3) and so are at increased risk for developing cervical cancer. Therefore, accurate triage of women with ASCUS or LSIL is required to identify those who need further management.  This review evaluates two ways to triage women with ASCUS or LSIL: repeating the cytological test, and DNA testing for high\u2010risk types of the human papillomavirus (hrHPV) \u2010 the main causal factor of cervical cancer.    Objectives Main objective  To compare the accuracy of hrHPV testing with the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) assay against that of repeat cytology for detection of underlying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) or grade 3 or worse (CIN3+) in women with ASCUS or LSIL. For the HC2 assay, a positive result was defined as proposed by the manufacturer. For repeat cytology, different cut\u2010offs were used to define positivity: Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or worse (ASCUS+), low\u2010grade squamous intra\u2010epithelial lesions or worse (LSIL+) or high\u2010grade squamous intra\u2010epithelial lesions or worse (HSIL+).  Secondary objective  To assess the accuracy of the HC2 assay to detect CIN2+ or CIN3+ in women with ASCUS or LSIL in a larger group of reports of studies that applied hrHPV testing and the reference standard (coloscopy and biopsy), irrespective whether or not repeat cytology was done.    Search methods We made a comprehensive literature search that included the Cochrane Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (through PubMed), and EMBASE (last search 6 January 2011).\u00a0 Selected journals likely to contain relevant papers were handsearched from 1992 to 2010 (December).\u00a0We also searched CERVIX, the bibliographic database of the Unit of Cancer Epidemiology at the Scientific Institute of Public Health (Brussels, Belgium) which contains more than 20,000 references on cervical cancer.  More recent searches, up to December 2012, targeted reports on the accuracy of triage of ASCUS or LSIL with other HPV DNA assays, or HPV RNA assays and other molecular markers. These searches will be used for new Cochrane reviews as well as for updates of the current review.    Selection criteria Studies eligible for inclusion in the review had to include: women presenting with a cervical cytology result of ASCUS or LSIL, who had undergone both HC2 testing and repeat cytology, or HC2 testing alone, and were subsequently subjected to reference standard verification with colposcopy and colposcopy\u2010directed biopsies for histologic verification.    Data collection and analysis The review authors independently extracted data from the selected studies, and obtained additional data from report authors.  Two groups of meta\u2010analyses were performed: group I concerned triage of women with ASCUS, group II concerned women with LSIL.\u00a0\u00a0  The bivariate model (METADAS\u2010macro in SAS) was used to assess the absolute accuracy of the triage tests in both groups as well as the differences in accuracy between the triage tests.    Main results The pooled sensitivity of HC2 was significantly higher than that of repeat cytology at cut\u2010off ASCUS+ to detect CIN2+ in both triage of ASCUS and LSIL (relative sensitivity of 1.27 (95% CI 1.16 to 1.39; P value < 0.0001) and 1.23 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.4; P value 0.007), respectively. In ASCUS triage, the pooled specificity of the triage methods did not differ significantly from each other (relative specificity: 0.99 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.03; P value 0.98)). However, the specificity of HC2 was substantially, and significantly, lower than that of repeat cytology in the triage of LSIL (relative specificity: 0.66 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.75) P value < 0.0001).    Authors' conclusions HPV\u2010triage with HC2 can be recommended to triage women with ASCUS because it has higher accuracy (significantly higher sensitivity, and similar specificity) than repeat cytology.When triaging women with LSIL, an HC2 test yields a significantly higher sensitivity, but a significantly lower specificity, compared to a repeat cytology. Therefore, practice recommendations for management of women with LSIL should be balanced, taking local circumstances into account.",

        "Types of studies": "Two types of studies were considered: Studies with concomitant testing where all study participants were tested with the HC2 assay and repeat cytology, followed by verification with the reference standard; and studies where all study participants were tested only with HC2 followed by verification with the reference standard (coloscopy and biopsy).    Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) where study participants were randomised to HPV\u2010based triage or repeat cytology, and where, subsequently, all women were submitted to verification with the reference standard (coloscopy and biopsy). Studies with concomitant testing where all study participants were tested with the HC2 assay and repeat cytology, followed by verification with the reference standard; and studies where all study participants were tested only with HC2 followed by verification with the reference standard (coloscopy and biopsy). Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) where study participants were randomised to HPV\u2010based triage or repeat cytology, and where, subsequently, all women were submitted to verification with the reference standard (coloscopy and biopsy).",
        "Participants": "Participants were women with a cervical cytology result of ASCUS (triage group I) or LSIL (triage group II) detected in the framework of cervical cancer screening. For a discussion on the cytological definitions of ASCUS and LSIL the reader is referred to Appendix 1.",
        "Index tests": "The index test was the B probe of the HC2 assay, which detects DNA of 13 hrHPV types (see Index test(s)). For the main meta\u2010analysis on the accuracy of triage with HC2, the review authors only considered the standard cut\u2010off of test positivity as defined by the manufacturer. This standard cut\u2010off of test positivity corresponds with a light signal of the test sample equivalent to that of a positive control containing 1 pg/mL of HPV DNA (RLU = 1).",
        "Comparator tests": "The conventional strategy to triage women with ASCUS or LSIL is to repeat the cytology test. Usually triage is done within six months after the first observation of ASCUS or LSIL. However, in practice this delay can vary between three to 12 months. When the result of the repeat cytology test is positive, women are referred for further diagnostic investigation with the reference standard. Three possible cut\u2010offs to define a positive repeat cytology result will be distinguished: ASCUS+, LSIL+, and high\u2010grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse (HSIL+). Cervical cytology testing can be performed with: (1) the Pap smear, where cellular material scraped from the transformation zone of the cervix is transferred to a glass slide and fixed, or (2) using liquid cytology, where scraped cervical cells are transferred into a vial with fixating fluid (Arbyn 2007; Arbyn 2008a). Comparison of the accuracy of repeat cytology (comparator test) with HC2 (index test) was an optional selection criterion for inclusion in the review.",
        "Target conditions": "Presence of histologically\u2010confirmed high\u2010grade CIN was the target outcome of disease. Two separate outcomes were distinguished: CIN2 or worse disease (CIN2, CIN3, invasive squamous cervical cancer, and adenocarcinoma of the cervix (CIN2+));    CIN3 or worse (CIN3, invasive squamous cervical cancer, and adenocarcinoma of the cervix (CIN3+)). CIN2 or worse disease (CIN2, CIN3, invasive squamous cervical cancer, and adenocarcinoma of the cervix (CIN2+)); CIN3 or worse (CIN3, invasive squamous cervical cancer, and adenocarcinoma of the cervix (CIN3+)). CIN3 is the most relevant clinical outcome, since it is considered to be an obvious precursor of cervical cancer, whereas CIN2 is a mixed condition that is less reproducible, with a lower probability of progression to cervical cancer. However, the outcome CIN2+ is reported more often than CIN3+. See Appendix 1 for a more detailed discussion on the natural history of the different degrees of CIN.",
        "Reference standards": "The following reference standards were considered as acceptable for judging on presence or absence of the target condition: colposcopy and colposcopy\u2010directed punch biopsies or excision biopsies by large loop excision of the transformation zone or conization, with or without endocervical curettage, followed by histological verification of the biopsy specimen. Cases where no biopsy was taken, because colposcopy was negative and satisfactory, were considered as being free of CIN2+. An overview of the key elements of the Cochrane review is summarised in Table 1. Study questions What is the accuracy of HPV DNA testing and repeat cytology to detect CIN2, or worse (CIN2+), disease in women with ASCUS or LSIL? Patient population Women with a cervical cytology result showing ASCUS or LSIL. Prior testing Prior screening, screening for first time, or not documented. Setting Cervical cancer screening using cytology and follow\u2010up of women with minor cytological lesions. Index test Triage with HPV DNA testing using HC2 (test positivity defined as RLU > 1). Comparator test Triage with repeat cytology considered at 3 cut\u2010offs (ASCUS+, LSIL+, HSIL+). Target disease Cervical cancer precursors: CIN2+ or CIN3+. Reference standard Colposcopy with colposcopy\u2010targeted biopsies or biopsies from all cases, considering the histological result as the outcome, where available, but accepting negative colposcopy as sufficient ascertainment for absence of CIN2+ or CIN3+ when no biopsies were taken. Importance ASCUS and LSIL indicate an increased risk for having or developing cervical precancer. Nevertheless, frequently no underlying or incipient precursors CIN2+ can be identified.\u00a0 Therefore, accurate triage methods are needed that identify women with cervical precancer who are at increased risk for developing cancer, but that also avoid over\u2010diagnosis and over\u2010treatment. Studies 1) Triage of ASCUS Outcome CIN2+: 39 studies (including 13,196 women) allowing evaluation of the accuracy of HC2; 10 of these studies (including 5261 women) permitted investigation of the accuracy of repeat cytology. Outcome CIN3+: 17 studies (6144 women) with accuracy of HC2; 4 of these studies (2726 women) allowed assessment of accuracy of both HC2 and repeat cytology. 2) Triage of LSIL Outcome CIN2+: 24 studies (including 9983 women) allowed evaluation of the accuracy of HC2; 6 of these studies (including 1591 women) also allowed assessment of the accuracy of repeat cytology. Outcome CIN3+: 14 studies (8253 women) with accuracy of HC2; 4 of these studies (1295 women) permitted assessment of accuracy of both HC2 and repeat cytology. Abbreviations ASCUS = atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance ASCUS+ = ASCUS or worse CIN2 = cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 CIN2+ = cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or worse CIN3+ = cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 3 or worse HC2 = Hybrid Capture 2 assay HPV = human papillomavirus HSIL+ = high\u2010grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse LSIL = low\u2010grade squamous intra\u2010epithelial lesions LSIL+ = LSIL or worse RLU = relative light units"

        "Appendix 1. Classifications used for reporting cervical epithelial lesions": "Cytological classification In the current review two groups of participants are considered: triage group I (women with equivocal cervical lesions or ASCUS) and triage group II (women with low\u2010grade cytological grade cytological lesions or LSIL).  In triage group I, participants are women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), as defined in the 1988 version of The Bethesda System (TBS) (Lundberg 1989). In the 1991 version of TBS (Luff 1992), subclassification of the equivocal category of ASCUS was proposed: (a) atypical squamous cells favouring a benign reactive process squamous cells of undetermined significance(ASC\u2010R); (b) undetermined significance and (c) neoplasia cannot be excluded.\u00a0In TBS\u20102001, the first subcategory (ASC\u2010R) was included with \u201cnegative for neoplasia or malignancy\u201d, whereas the second and third subcategories were identified as ASC\u2010US (with hyphen; atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) and ASC\u2010H (atypical squamous cells where a high grade lesion cannot be excluded), respectively.\u00a0 For the current meta\u2010analysis, if possible the number of ASCUS cases will be computed from the respective subcategories.\u00a0In publications using TBS\u20102001, where this was not possible, only data on ASC\u2010US cases will be extracted.\u00a0Studies reporting data exclusively on ASC\u2010R or ASC\u2010H will be excluded from the main meta\u2010analysis, but will be included in subgroup meta\u2010analyses.  Glandular cytological lesions (AGUS (atypical glandular cells of undermined significance), and AGC (atypical glandular cells)) are rare findings that are not the focus of the current review. However, when triage data concern women with squamous or glandular atypia and the outcome of glandular lesions is not documented separately, the whole triage group will be considered as ASCUS. Studies reporting data exclusively on glandular atypia will be excluded from the main meta\u2010analysis but will be included in subgroup meta\u2010analyses.  In triage group II, participants will be women with low\u2010grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL). The definition of low\u2010grade squamous intraepithelial lesions remained unchanged in the successive versions of TBS.  The terminology of the British Society of Clinical Cytology (BSCC), used by NHSCSP (Evans 1986), will be translated into TBS\u20101988. The BSCC terms borderline cytology and mild dyskaryosis will be considered as similar to ASCUS and LSIL, respectively (Dudding 2002).  Table 3 contains all the categories of cervical neoplastic changes (from normal to cancer), used in different classification systems. It formed the basis for translation of different terminologies into TBS 1988, used in the current systematic review.    Histological classification Throughout the current review, the CIN nomenclature is used to describe histologically\u2010confirmed dysplasia of the cervical squamous epithelium (Richart 1973), whereas TBS is used to describe cytological cervical lesions (see Table 3 and Appendix 1). CIN1 (mild dysplasia) has a low potential of progression to cancer (Holowaty 1999; Ostor 1993). Moreover, cytological, virological and molecular profiles of CIN1 appear to be similar to that of epithelium without CIN (Wentzensen 2008). On the other hand, CIN2 (moderate dysplasia), and in particular CIN3 (severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ), indicate a considerable risk of developing cancer (Holowaty 1999; Ostor 1993). Consensus exists to recommend treatment of CIN2 and CIN3 (Jordan 2008a), and, therefore, they are often included within the term high\u2010grade CIN. However, it is clinically relevant to distinguish CIN2 from CIN3 (Herbert 2008). CIN2 is an intermediate condition, which contains over\u2010called CIN1 and under\u2010called CIN3 (Sherman 2002). CIN3 (encompassing severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ) is a more progressive and reproducible histological diagnosis than CIN2 (Ismail 1989; Ostor 1993). Therefore, in the current review, the authors will assess the accuracy separately for both outcomes:     CIN2 or worse disease (CIN2, CIN3, invasive squamous cervical cancer and adenocarcinoma of the cervix) (CIN2+));    CIN3 or worse (CIN3, invasive squamous cervical cancer and adenocarcinoma of the cervix (CIN3+)).
