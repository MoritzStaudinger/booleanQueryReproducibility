    "title": "Optic nerve head and fibre layer imaging for diagnosing glaucoma",
    "abstract": "Background The diagnosis of glaucoma is traditionally based on the finding of optic nerve head (ONH) damage assessed subjectively by ophthalmoscopy or photography or by corresponding damage to the visual field assessed by automated perimetry, or both. Diagnostic assessments are usually required when ophthalmologists or primary eye care professionals find elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) or a suspect appearance of the ONH. Imaging tests such as confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (HRT), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and scanning laser polarimetry (SLP, as used by the GDx instrument), provide an objective measure of the structural changes of retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness and ONH parameters occurring in glaucoma.    Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of HRT, OCT and GDx for diagnosing manifest glaucoma by detecting ONH and RNFL damage.    Search methods We searched several databases for this review. The most recent searches were on 19 February 2015.    Selection criteria We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies and case\u2010control studies that evaluated the accuracy of OCT, HRT or the GDx for diagnosing glaucoma. We excluded population\u2010based screening studies, since we planned to consider studies on self\u2010referred people or participants in whom a risk factor for glaucoma had already been identified in primary care, such as elevated IOP or a family history of glaucoma. We only considered recent commercial versions of the tests: spectral domain OCT, HRT III and GDx VCC or ECC.    Data collection and analysis We adopted standard Cochrane methods. We fitted a hierarchical summary ROC (HSROC) model using the METADAS macro in SAS software. After studies were selected, we decided to use 2 x 2 data at 0.95 specificity or closer in meta\u2010analyses, since this was the most commonly\u2010reported level.    Main results We included 106 studies in this review, which analysed 16,260 eyes (8353 cases, 7907 controls) in total. Forty studies (5574 participants) assessed GDx, 18 studies (3550 participants) HRT, and 63 (9390 participants) OCT, with 12 of these studies comparing two or three tests. Regarding study quality, a case\u2010control design in 103 studies raised concerns as it can overestimate accuracy and reduce the applicability of the results to daily practice. Twenty\u2010four studies were sponsored by the manufacturer, and in 15 the potential conflict of interest was unclear.  Comparisons made within each test were more reliable than those between tests, as they were mostly based on direct comparisons within each study.The Nerve Fibre Indicator yielded the highest accuracy (estimate, 95% confidence interval (CI)) among GDx parameters (sensitivity: 0.67, 0.55 to 0.77; specificity: 0.94, 0.92 to 0.95). For HRT measures, the Vertical Cup/Disc (C/D) ratio (sensitivity: 0.72, 0.60 to 0.68; specificity: 0.94, 0.92 to 0.95) was no different from other parameters. With OCT, the accuracy of average RNFL retinal thickness was similar to the inferior sector (0.72, 0.65 to 0.77; specificity: 0.93, 0.92 to 0.95) and, in different studies, to the vertical C/D ratio.  Comparing the parameters with the highest diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) for each device in a single HSROC model, the performance of GDx, HRT and OCT was remarkably similar. At a sensitivity of 0.70 and a high specificity close to 0.95 as in most of these studies, in 1000 people referred by primary eye care, of whom 200 have manifest glaucoma, such as in those who have already undergone some functional or anatomic testing by optometrists, the best measures of GDx, HRT and OCT would miss about 60 cases out of the 200 patients with glaucoma, and would incorrectly refer 50 out of 800 patients without glaucoma. If prevalence were 5%, e.g. such as in people referred only because of family history of glaucoma, the corresponding figures would be 15 patients missed out of 50 with manifest glaucoma, avoiding referral of about 890 out of 950 non\u2010glaucomatous people.  Heterogeneity investigations found that sensitivity estimate was higher for studies with more severe glaucoma, expressed as worse average mean deviation (MD): 0.79 (0.74 to 0.83) for MD < \u20106 db versus 0.64 (0.60 to 0.69) for MD \u2265 \u20106 db, at a similar summary specificity (0.93, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.94 and, respectively, 0.94; 95% CI 0.93 to 0.95; P < 0.0001 for the difference in relative DOR).    Authors' conclusions The accuracy of imaging tests for detecting manifest glaucoma was variable across studies, but overall similar for different devices. Accuracy may have been overestimated due to the case\u2010control design, which is a serious limitation of the current evidence base.  We recommend that further diagnostic accuracy studies are carried out on patients selected consecutively at a defined step of the clinical pathway, providing a description of risk factors leading to referral and bearing in mind the consequences of false positives and false negatives in the setting in which the diagnostic question is made. Future research should report accuracy for each threshold of these continuous measures, or publish raw data.",

        "Types of studies": "We planned to include all prospective and retrospective cohort studies and case\u2010control studies that evaluate the accuracy of OCT, HRT or the GDx for diagnosing glaucoma. We included both single studies assessing each imaging method and comparative studies assessing more than one imaging method in the same patient population.\u00a0We included only studies that provide data to allow calculation of sensitivity and specificity estimates. A first draft of this review was submitted based on a literature search conducted until 15 June 2013, which identified a large number of case\u2010control studies. During the revision of the final version of this review, we updated the search to 15 February 2015 and found some additional case\u2010control studies. We decided not to include these additional case\u2010control studies, as they are known to be prone to methodological biases and unlikely to change the current evidence base. Future updates of this review should only focus on studies where the patient population is enrolled consecutively, with the same set of inclusion criteria, such as referable patients identified in primary care. We applied no language restriction to the inclusion criteria of the studies.",
        "Participants": "The tests on which this review focuses have not been extensively studied in population\u2010based screening studies, which should be the subject of a future Cochrane review on screening tests for glaucoma. The published protocol for this review stated we would include glaucoma suspects, but did not fully specify the professional and clinical pathway stage at which such a question is made. Framing the question in a well\u2010defined pathay is also difficult due to variation of eye care pattens in different health care settings. In retrospect, the findings of this review could be used in an add\u2010on setting which could be a primary care, or a triage setting when somebody has already been referred from primary care to secondary care as suspect glaucoma and needs triage by a non glaucoma specialist",
        "Index tests": "We assessed the following imaging devices: confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (HRT); optical coherence tomography (OCT); and scanning laser polarimetry (GDx). For each test we extracted and analysed all parameters which can be obtained with standard commercial software and are measuring RNFL or ONH morphology. During the review process, we decided to extract OCT measures that are not related to RNFL and ONH morphology, but to macular cell layers affected by glaucoma, such as ganglion cell complex (GCC) and ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIPL), as these parameters have gained popularity in recent years.",
        "Target conditions": "The target condition of interest was manifest glaucoma.",
        "Reference standards": "There is no universally\u2010accepted reference standard for the diagnosis of manifest glaucoma. Both optic disc and visual field damage are used to diagnose the presence of glaucoma. Several systems have been proposed to score visual field and optic disc damage and have been tested in multicentre randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (AGIS 1994; CIGTS 1999; EMGT 1999). While we accepted any diagnosis of glaucoma given by the study investigators, we conducted subgroup analyses to assess whether differences between studies could be explained by the choice of the reference standard."
