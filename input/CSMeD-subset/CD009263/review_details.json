    "title": "123I\u2010MIBG scintigraphy and 18F\u2010FDG\u2010PET imaging for diagnosing neuroblastoma",
    "abstract": "Background Neuroblastoma is an embryonic tumour of childhood that originates in the neural crest. It is the second most common extracranial malignant solid tumour of childhood.  Neuroblastoma cells have the unique capacity to accumulate Iodine\u2010123\u2010metaiodobenzylguanidine (\u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG), which can be used for imaging the tumour. Moreover, \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG scintigraphy is not only important for the diagnosis of neuroblastoma, but also for staging and localization of skeletal lesions. If these are present, MIBG follow\u2010up scans are used to assess the patient's response to therapy. However, the sensitivity and specificity of \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG scintigraphy to detect neuroblastoma varies according to the literature.  Prognosis, treatment and response to therapy of patients with neuroblastoma are currently based on extension scoring of \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG scans. Due to its clinical use and importance, it is necessary to determine the exact diagnostic accuracy of \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG scintigraphy. In case the tumour is not MIBG avid, fluorine\u201018\u2010fluorodeoxy\u2010glucose (18F\u2010FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is often used and the diagnostic accuracy of this test should also be assessed.    Objectives Primary objectives: 1.1\u00a0To determine the diagnostic accuracy of \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG (single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), with or without computed tomography (CT)) scintigraphy for detecting a neuroblastoma and its metastases at first diagnosis or at recurrence in children from 0 to 18 years old.  1.2\u00a0To determine the diagnostic accuracy of negative \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG scintigraphy in combination with 18F\u2010FDG\u2010PET(\u2010CT) imaging for detecting a neuroblastoma and its metastases at first diagnosis or at recurrence in children from 0 to 18 years old, i.e. an add\u2010on test.  Secondary objectives: 2.1 To determine the diagnostic accuracy of 18F\u2010FDG\u2010PET(\u2010CT) imaging for detecting a neuroblastoma and its metastases at first diagnosis or at recurrence in children from 0 to 18 years old.  2.2 To compare the diagnostic accuracy of \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG (SPECT\u2010CT) and 18F\u2010FDG\u2010PET(\u2010CT) imaging for detecting a neuroblastoma and its metastases at first diagnosis or at recurrence in children from 0 to 18 years old. This was performed within and between included studies. \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG (SPECT\u2010CT) scintigraphy was the comparator test in this case.    Search methods We searched the databases of MEDLINE/PubMed (1945 to 11 September 2012) and EMBASE/Ovid (1980 to 11 September 2012) for potentially relevant articles. Also we checked the reference lists of relevant articles and review articles, scanned conference proceedings and searched for unpublished studies by contacting researchers involved in this area.    Selection criteria We included studies of a cross\u2010sectional design or cases series of proven neuroblastoma, either retrospective or prospective, if they compared the results of \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG (SPECT\u2010CT) scintigraphy or 18F\u2010FDG\u2010PET(\u2010CT) imaging, or both, with the reference standards or with each other. Studies had to be primary diagnostic and report on children aged between 0 to 18 years old with a neuroblastoma of any stage at first diagnosis or at recurrence.    Data collection and analysis One review author performed the initial screening of identified references. Two review authors independently performed the study selection, extracted data and assessed the methodological quality.  We used data from two\u2010by\u2010two tables, describing at least the number of patients with a true positive test and the number of patients with a false negative test, to calculate the sensitivity, and if possible, the specificity for each included study.  If possible, we generated forest plots showing estimates of sensitivity and specificity together with 95% confidence intervals.    Main results Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Ten studies reported data on patient level: the scan was positive or negative. One study reported on all single lesions (lesion level). The sensitivity of \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG (SPECT\u2010CT) scintigraphy (objective 1.1), determined in 608 of 621 eligible patients included in the 11 studies, varied from 67% to 100%. One study, that reported on a lesion level, provided data to calculate the specificity: 68% in 115 lesions in 22 patients. The sensitivity of \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG scintigraphy for detecting metastases separately from the primary tumour in patients with all neuroblastoma stages ranged from 79% to 100% in three studies and the specificity ranged from 33% to 89% for two of these studies.  One study reported on the diagnostic accuracy of 18F\u2010FDG\u2010PET(\u2010CT) imaging (add\u2010on test) in patients with negative \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG scintigraphy (objective 1.2). Two of the 24 eligible patients with proven neuroblastoma had a negative \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG scan and a positive 18F\u2010FDG\u2010PET(\u2010CT) scan.  The sensitivity of 18F\u2010FDG\u2010PET(\u2010CT) imaging as a single diagnostic test (objective 2.1) and compared to \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG (SPECT\u2010CT) (objective 2.2) was only reported in one study. The sensitivity of 18F\u2010FDG\u2010PET(\u2010CT) imaging was 100% versus 92% of \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG (SPECT\u2010CT) scintigraphy. We could not calculate the specificity for both modalities.    Authors' conclusions The reported sensitivities of \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3\u2010I MIBG scintigraphy for the detection of neuroblastoma and its metastases ranged from 67 to 100% in patients with histologically proven neuroblastoma.  Only one study in this review reported on false positive findings. It is important to keep in mind that false positive findings can occur. For example, physiological uptake should be ruled out, by using SPECT\u2010CT scans, although more research is needed before definitive conclusions can be made.  As described both in the literature and in this review, in about 10% of the patients with histologically proven neuroblastoma the tumour does not accumulate \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG (false negative results). For these patients, it is advisable to perform an additional test for staging and assess response to therapy. Additional tests might for example be 18F\u2010FDG\u2010PET(\u2010CT), but to be certain of its clinical value, more evidence is needed.  The diagnostic accuracy of 18F\u2010FDG\u2010PET(\u2010CT) imaging in case of a negative \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG scintigraphy could not be calculated, because only very limited data were available. Also the detection of the diagnostic accuracy of index test 18F\u2010FDG\u2010PET(\u2010CT) imaging for detecting a neuroblastoma tumour and its metastases, and to compare this to comparator test \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG (SPECT\u2010CT) scintigraphy, could not be calculated because of the limited available data at time of this search.  At the start of this project, we did not expect to find only very limited data on specificity. We now consider it would have been more appropriate to use the term \"the sensitivity to assess the presence of neuroblastoma\" instead of \"diagnostic accuracy\" for the objectives.",

        "Types of studies": "We included primary diagnostic studies if they compared the results of \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG (SPECT\u2010CT) scintigraphy, 18F\u2010FDG\u2010PET(\u2010CT) imaging, or both, with the tests described as reference standards (as defined below) and if they compared the results of both tests with each other. Studies needed to be of a cross\u2010sectional design or a case series of proven neuroblastoma. Patient selection could be either retrospective or prospective. We excluded case reports, studies that described fewer than ten patients suspected for neuroblastoma and diagnostic case\u2010control studies. Studies had to report sufficient data to construct (part of) a two\u2010by\u2010two table, i.e. at least the absolute number of true positives and false negatives had to be available from the data reported in the primary studies or obtainable from the study authors to calculate the sensitivity and if possible the specificity. \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I\u2010MIBG scintigraphy is only performed when there is a high suspicion of a neuroblastoma based on clinical information, excretion of catecholamines in the urine and different imaging methods. Therefore, it is expected that mainly the outcome of MIBG scans in patients with finally proven neuroblastoma will be reported and that thus often only sensitivity can be analysed.",

        "Reference standards": "The optimal combination of reference tests is described below. However, we did not exclude studies that did not use the optimal combination of reference tests. The reference tests for the diagnosis of the primary neuroblastoma tumour were as follows: An unequivocal pathological diagnosis according to the Shimada classification or the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification (INPC) (Brodeur 1984; Joshi 2000; Peuchmaur 2003; Shimada 1984; Shimada 1993; Shimada 1999a; Shimada 1999b; Shimada 2003). Tumour tissue was examined by use of light or electron microscopy with immunohistochemistry. At least two of the following antigens had to be positive: neuron\u2010specific enolase (NSE), synaptophysin or chromogranin A (CGA). Tissue had to be preferably obtained by the use of Trucut, core\u2010needle biopsy. However, if this approach was contra\u2010indicated, fine\u2010needle aspiration could be used (Brodeur 1993).    A bone marrow aspirate or trephine biopsy containing unequivocal tumour cells. These are immunocytologically positive clumps of cells, containing antibodies against at least two of the following antigens: NSE, synaptophysin or CGA (Brodeur 1993).    Histopathology during or after treatment (e.g. tissue obtained during surgery), if excretion of catecholamines in the urine was elevated at diagnosis and additional imaging modalities (e.g. ultrasound, CT scan, MRI scan) suggested a neuroblastoma at diagnosis. An unequivocal pathological diagnosis according to the Shimada classification or the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification (INPC) (Brodeur 1984; Joshi 2000; Peuchmaur 2003; Shimada 1984; Shimada 1993; Shimada 1999a; Shimada 1999b; Shimada 2003).

Histopathology during or after treatment (e.g. tissue obtained during surgery), if excretion of catecholamines in the urine was elevated at diagnosis and additional imaging modalities (e.g. ultrasound, CT scan, MRI scan) suggested a neuroblastoma at diagnosis. Three different tests were used as possible reference standards. If only one of the three reference standards had a positive result, the diagnosis neuroblastoma could be confirmed. However, to reject the diagnosis neuroblastoma all three had to give a negative result. The reference tests for the diagnosis of neuroblastoma metastases (separately from the primary tumour) were as follows: Bone marrow metastases: To determine bone marrow invasion, at least two different puncture sites were mandatory (although four puncture sites should always be aimed for). Representative smears (five smears from each puncture site) and EDTA/heparin bone marrow (3 to 5 mL from each puncture site) had to be sampled for PCR or immunocytology, or both. Only if no fluid bone marrow in sufficient quality or quantity could be aspirated, trephine biopsies from this puncture site are recommended (Beiske 2009).      Bone metastases: Positive lesions on a 99m\u2010Tc skeleton scintigraphy, MRI, CT scan, or a combination of these tests.    Lymph node metastases: Histologically proven palpable nodes or ultrasound, MRI or CT scan for non\u2010palpable nodes, or both.    Liver metastases: Ultrasound, MRI, CT scan or a combination of these tests. Bone marrow metastases: To determine bone marrow invasion, at least two different puncture sites were mandatory (although four puncture sites should always be aimed for). Representative smears (five smears from each puncture site) and EDTA/heparin bone marrow (3 to 5 mL from each puncture site) had to be sampled for PCR or immunocytology, or both.

Bone metastases: Positive lesions on a 99m\u2010Tc skeleton scintigraphy, MRI, CT scan, or a combination of these tests. Lymph node metastases: Histologically proven palpable nodes or ultrasound, MRI or CT scan for non\u2010palpable nodes, or both. Liver metastases: Ultrasound, MRI, CT scan or a combination of these tests. Diagnosis of neuroblastoma metastases resulted from at least one positive result of these reference tests. The result for the metastases was assumed negative if all reference tests were negative. There are no inadequate reference standards in the diagnostic process of neuroblastoma. Histopathology is the gold standard, but it is not always possible to perform. Therefore other reference tests, when combined, are also needed in the diagnosis of neuroblastoma."
