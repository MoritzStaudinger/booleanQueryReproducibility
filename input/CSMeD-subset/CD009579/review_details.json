    "title": "Circulating antigen tests and urine reagent strips for diagnosis of active schistosomiasis in endemic areas",
    "abstract": "Background Point\u2010of\u2010care (POC) tests for diagnosing schistosomiasis include tests based on circulating antigen detection and urine reagent strip tests. If they had sufficient diagnostic accuracy they could replace conventional microscopy as they provide a quicker answer and are easier to use.    Objectives To summarise the diagnostic accuracy of: a) urine reagent strip tests in detecting active Schistosoma haematobium infection, with microscopy as the reference standard; and b) circulating antigen tests for detecting active Schistosoma infection in geographical regions endemic for Schistosoma mansoni or S. haematobium or both, with microscopy as the reference standard.    Search methods We searched the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, MEDION, and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) without language restriction up to 30 June 2014.    Selection criteria We included studies that used microscopy as the reference standard: for S. haematobium, microscopy of urine prepared by filtration, centrifugation, or sedimentation methods; and for S. mansoni, microscopy of stool by Kato\u2010Katz thick smear. We included studies on participants residing in endemic areas only.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed quality of the data using QUADAS\u20102, and performed meta\u2010analysis where appropriate. Using the variability of test thresholds, we used the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model for all eligible tests (except the circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) POC for S. mansoni, where the bivariate random\u2010effects model was more appropriate). We investigated heterogeneity, and carried out indirect comparisons where data were sufficient. Results for sensitivity and specificity are presented as percentages with 95% confidence intervals (CI).    Main results We included 90 studies; 88 from field settings in Africa. The median S. haematobium infection prevalence was 41% (range 1% to 89%) and 36% for S. mansoni (range 8% to 95%). Study design and conduct were poorly reported against current standards.  Tests for S. haematobium   Urine reagent test strips versus microscopy  Compared to microscopy, the detection of microhaematuria on test strips had the highest sensitivity and specificity (sensitivity 75%, 95% CI 71% to 79%; specificity 87%, 95% CI 84% to 90%; 74 studies, 102,447 participants). For proteinuria, sensitivity was 61% and specificity was 82% (82,113 participants); and for leukocyturia, sensitivity was 58% and specificity 61% (1532 participants). However, the difference in overall test accuracy between the urine reagent strips for microhaematuria and proteinuria was not found to be different when we compared separate populations (P = 0.25), or when direct comparisons within the same individuals were performed (paired studies; P = 0.21).  When tests were evaluated against the higher quality reference standard (when multiple samples were analysed), sensitivity was marginally lower for microhaematuria (71% vs 75%) and for proteinuria (49% vs 61%). The specificity of these tests was comparable.  Antigen assay  Compared to microscopy, the CCA test showed considerable heterogeneity; meta\u2010analytic sensitivity estimate was 39%, 95% CI 6% to 73%; specificity 78%, 95% CI 55% to 100% (four studies, 901 participants).  Tests for S. mansoni   Compared to microscopy, the CCA test meta\u2010analytic estimates for detecting S. mansoni at a single threshold of trace positive were: sensitivity 89% (95% CI 86% to 92%); and specificity 55% (95% CI 46% to 65%; 15 studies, 6091 participants) Against a higher quality reference standard, the sensitivity results were comparable (89% vs 88%) but specificity was higher (66% vs 55%). For the CAA test, sensitivity ranged from 47% to 94%, and specificity from 8% to 100% (four studies, 1583 participants).    Authors' conclusions Among the evaluated tests for S. haematobium infection, microhaematuria correctly detected the largest proportions of infections and non\u2010infections identified by microscopy.  The CCA POC test for S. mansoni detects a very large proportion of infections identified by microscopy, but it misclassifies a large proportion of microscopy negatives as positives in endemic areas with a moderate to high prevalence of infection, possibly because the test is potentially more sensitive than microscopy.",

        "Types of studies": "We included primary observational studies that compared the results of one or more of the index tests versus the reference standard. These studies could be cross\u2010sectional in design, cohort studies, or diagnostic case\u2010control studies with cases and controls sampled from the same patient population. We included studies that provide participant data. Only studies in which true\u2010positives (TPs), true\u2010negatives (TNs), false\u2010positives (FPs), and false\u2010negatives (FNs) were reported or could be extracted from the data were included. We excluded case\u2010control studies with healthy controls, controls from non\u2010endemic areas, or controls with alternative diagnoses (patients with diseases similar to schistosomiasis), as specificity may be overestimated (Rutjes 2005). False\u2010positive test results may occur when an alternative disease produces the same pathophysiological changes as the target condition. We also excluded studies that enrolled only participants with proven schistosomiasis, as sensitivity may be overestimated.",
        "Participants": "Participants had to be individuals residing in regions where S. haematobium and S. mansoni infections were endemic. We excluded articles that studied travelers originating from non\u2010endemic countries, as they were typically screened with other tests such as antibody tests.",
        "Index tests": "We included studies that evaluated the following tests. A urine reagent strip test is a biochemical semiquantitative test. It is regarded as an indirect indicator of S. haematobium infection or morbidity, as it detects microhaematuria, proteinuria, or leukocyturia (white blood cells in urine) that can develop as a consequence of schistosomal infection (Doehring 1985b;Doehring 1988). This test is cheap and easy to use for rapid screening of urinary schistosomiasis (Feldmeier 1993; Gryseels 2006; Gryseels 2012). The results of urine reagent tests used to measure haematuria are scored as 0 (negative), trace\u2010positive (tr), 1+ (5 to 10 erythrocytes/\u03bcL), 2++ (10 to 50 erythrocytes/\u03bcL), or 3+++ (50 to 250 erythrocytes/\u03bcL). For proteinuria, results are scored as 0 (negative), trace\u2010positive (tr), 1+ (30 mg protein/dL), 2++ (100 mg protein/dL), or 3+++ (500 mg protein/dL) (Murare 1987). Antigen tests are based on detection of schistosome antigens in the serum and urine of individuals (Gryseels 2006; WHO/TDR 2006; Gryseels 2012). The main circulating antigens are adult worm gut\u2013associated circulating antigens, and CAA and CCA are the main focus of research. The CCA dipstick is scored according to test band reaction intensity as negative (\u2010), trace\u2010positive (tr), single\u2010positive (+), double\u2010positive (++), and triple\u2010positive (+++) (Stothard 2006). ELISA results are continuous, and positivity thresholds may vary. To estimate the accuracy of ELISA tests, ELISA must have been evaluated against the reference standard only.",

        "Target conditions": "Active infection with S. haematobium. Active infection with S. mansoni.",
        "Reference standards": "For diagnosis of S. haematobium infection, the reference standard is microscopy of urine for examination of schistosome eggs. To increase sensitivity, urine samples can be concentrated by sedimentation, filtration, or centrifugation techniques (Gryseels 2006), or more samples can be examined (Feldmeier 1993). We therefore included studies that use all of these concentration techniques, and to estimate the effect of the quality of the reference standard, we accepted studies using microscopy on a single urine sample (lower\u2010quality reference standard) and studies performing microscopy on multiple urine samples (higher\u2010quality reference standard). For diagnosis of S. mansoni infection, microscopic examination of schistosome eggs in stool is the reference standard. Sensitivity is increased by preparing a faecal thick smear using the Kato\u2010Katz (KK) method (Gryseels 2006) or by examining multiple stool samples (Feldmeier 1993). To estimate the effect of the quality of the reference standard, we accepted studies using microscopy on a single stool sample (lower\u2010quality reference standard) and studies performing microscopy on multiple stool samples (higher\u2010quality reference standard). It is important to note that some regions experience mixed infections of S. haematobium and S. mansoni. In such situations, microscopy of both stool and urine samples must be carried out to confirm infection.",

Please indicate the design of the study by ticking one of the choices provided. We will not include case\u2010control studies that incorporate healthy controls, alternative diagnosis controls, or controls from non\u2010endemic areas. Research has shown that this type of study overestimates accuracy measures. Healthy controls are those who have been confirmed as disease\u2013free. Alternative diagnosis controls are controls who have symptoms similar to those of the disease under study.  If the design is not stated or is unclear, please tick the appropriate boxes. If necessary, insert comment into the box provided.    d. Was a consecutive or random sample of patients enrolled?    Yes: when the authors report random patient sampling or consecutive enrolment.   No: when patients were selected, for example, based on previous (reference or index) test results.    Unclear: there seems to be no problem, but the study authors do not explicitly state that patients were enrolled consecutively.       e. Did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions?    Yes: No patients were excluded after inclusion.   No: For example, when patients with mild disease were excluded, because they are more difficult to detect.    Unclear: not reported or insufficient information given to permit a decision.      f. Could the selection of patients have introduced bias?    High: if one or more of the questions above (7 d\u2010e) was answered with \u2018no.\u2019   Low: if all questions were answered with \u2018yes\u2019 (7 d\u2010e), or if at most one question was answered with \u2018unclear.\u2019    Unclear: for any other combination of answers (eg if two or more questions were unclear and the other(s) was/were answered with \u2018yes.\u2019       g. Is there a concern that the included patients do not match the review question?    High concern: when participants are those who do not reside in endemic areas, such as tourists, healthy controls, or controls with alternative diagnoses.    Low concern: when participants in the study are those who reside in schistosomiasis endemic areas. This group will include those at risk of infection, those who are infected but asymptomatic, or those who are infected with symptoms.    Unclear: scored when information is insufficient to permit a decision.       8. Patient flow and timing (Flow and Timing domain)  a. Was there an appropriate interval between index test(s) and reference standard?    Yes: if urine/stool samples are examined by both the reference standard and the index standard at the same time, or if the time period is less than one week.    No: if time period between index and reference standards is longer than one week.   Unclear: if no or insufficient information on time period is provided.      b. Did all patients receive a reference standard? (focus on those included in 2 \u00d7 2 table)     Yes: scored when the whole sample or a random selection of the sample or a selection of the sample with consecutive series receive verification using the reference standard.    No: scored when a part of the sample that is non\u2010randomly or non\u2010consecutively selected receives verification with the reference standard.    Unclear: scored when no or insufficient information is provided to ascertain whether the whole sample or a random selection of the sample received verification with a reference standard.       c. Did patients receive the same reference standard?    Yes: scored when study participants are tested with the same reference standard, urine/stool microscopy, regardless of index test result.    No: scored when microscopy is used with different urine concentration techniques depending on index test results for S. haematobium.    Unclear: scored when no or insufficient information is provided on the different reference standards used.       d. Were all patients included in the analysis?    Yes: scored when the patients who were included in the study were also included in the analysis.    No: scored when some patients/results are missing.   Unclear: scored when no or insufficient information is provided to permit a judgement.      e. Could the conduct or interpretation of the flow and timing have introduced bias?    High: if two or more questions above (8 a\u2010d) were answered with \u2018no.\u2019   Low: if all questions were answered with \u2018yes\u2019; or at least three and the other one with unclear.

Were the index test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard?     Yes: when results of the index tests are interpreted without knowledge of reference test results, or when index tests are done before the reference standard.    No: when results of the index tests are interpreted with knowledge of reference test results in cases when reference tests were used before the index tests.    Unclear: when information on when the index and reference tests were interpreted is insufficient.    Not stated: when no information was reported on this item.      c.

A prespecified threshold also includes statements such as, \u201cthe test was scored according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\u201d    No: when multiple cutoff values were tested and the best one chosen afterwards.   Unclear: when only one cutoff value was used, but this was not explicitly stated in the Methods section.    Not stated: when no information was reported on this item.   Could the conduct or interpretation of the index test have introduced bias?       High: if two or more questions above (9 a\u2010c) were answered with \u2018no.\u2019   Low: if questions (9 a\u2010c) were answered with \u2018yes.\u2019   Unclear: for any other combination of answers (eg both questions were unclear; one was unclear and one was \u2018yes\u2019).          10.

Is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition?    Yes: if measures to increase sensitivity are used (eg concentration techniques, multiple slides examined, stool sampled over a number of days. The recommended reference std for microscopy is one carried out on 3 stools or 3 urine samples (grading as follows: 1 sample; poor; 2 samples; moderate; 3 samples; good).    No: for example, if only ill children are sampled for the reference standard, or if stool samples with blood are thrown away to avoid contaminating technicians    Unclear: scored when information on the reference standard used or sample preparation technique used was insufficient.       j. Were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of results of the index test?     Yes: when results of the reference tests are interpreted without knowledge of index test results in cases when reference tests are used before the index standard.    No: when results of the reference tests are interpreted with knowledge of the index test results in cases in which index tests are used before reference tests.    Unclear: when information on when the index and reference tests were interpreted is insufficient.    Not stated: when no information on this item was reported.      k.
