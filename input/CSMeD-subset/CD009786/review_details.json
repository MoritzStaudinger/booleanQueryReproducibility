    "title": "Laparoscopy for diagnosing resectability of disease in women with advanced ovarian cancer",
    "abstract": "Background This is an update of a Cochrane Review that was originally published in 2014, Issue 2.  The presence of residual disease after primary debulking surgery is a highly significant prognostic factor in women with advanced ovarian cancer. In up to 60% of women, residual tumour of > 1 cm is left behind after primary debulking surgery (defined as suboptimal debulking). These women might have benefited from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) prior to interval debulking surgery instead of primary debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy. It is therefore important to select accurately those women who would best be treated with primary debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy from those who would benefit from NACT prior to surgery.    Objectives To determine if performing a laparoscopy, in addition to conventional diagnostic work\u2010up, in women suspected of advanced ovarian cancer is accurate in predicting the resectability of disease.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 6) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase via Ovid, MEDION and Science Citation Index and Conference Proceedings Citation Index (ISI Web of Science) to July 2018. We also checked references of identified primary studies and review articles.    Selection criteria We included studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy to determine the resectability of disease in women who are suspected of advanced ovarian cancer and planned to receive primary debulking surgery.    Data collection and analysis Pairs of review authors independently assessed the quality of included studies using QUADAS\u20102 and extracted data on study and participant characteristics, index test, target condition and reference standard. We extracted data for two\u2010by\u2010two tables and summarised these graphically. We calculated sensitivity and specificity and negative predictive values.    Main results We included 18 studies, reporting on 14 cohorts of women (including 1563 participants), of which one was a randomised controlled trial (RCT). Laparoscopic assessment suggested that disease was suitable for optimal debulking surgery (no macroscopic residual disease or residual disease < 1 cm (negative predictive values)) in 54% to 96% of women who had macroscopic complete debulking surgery (no visible disease at end of laparotomy) and in 69% to 100% of women who had optimal debulking surgery (residual tumour < 1 cm at end of laparotomy).  Only two studies avoided partial verification bias by operating on all women independent of laparoscopic findings, and provided data to calculate sensitivity and specificity. These two studies had no false positive laparoscopies (i.e. no women had a laparoscopy indicating unresectable disease and then went on to have optimal debulking surgery (no disease > 1 cm remaining)).  Due to the large heterogeneity pooling of the data was not possible for meta\u2010analysis.   Authors' conclusions Laparoscopy may be a useful tool to identify those women who have unresectable disease, as no women were inappropriately unexplored. However, some women had suboptimal primary debulking surgery, despite laparoscopy predicting optimal debulking and data are at high risk of verification bias as only two studies performed the reference standard (debulking laparotomy) in test (laparoscopy)\u2010positive women. Using a prediction model does not increase the sensitivity and will result in more unnecessarily explored women, due to a lower specificity.",

        "Types of studies": "We included studies that evaluated laparoscopy as a diagnostic test to determine resectability of disease in women suspected of advanced ovarian cancer who were scheduled for primary debulking surgery after conventional staging. In these studies the extensiveness of disease diagnosed with a laparoscopy was compared with the diagnosis at laparotomy. Case\u2010control studies were excluded from the review because of the risk of bias in this study design. We presumed that there would be studies in which not all women had undergone reference standard (i.e. laparotomy) when the index test was positive (i.e. unsuitable for primary debulking surgery as likely to lead to suboptimal result). Therefore, we also included studies in which only the participants who had a negative result of the index test (meaning the tumour was thought to be not too extensively spread to obtain optimal debulking result) underwent the reference standard (laparotomy).",
        "Participants": "Participants included women suspected of having advanced stage ovarian cancer (FIGO stage IIB, IIC, IIIA\u2010C and IVA\u2010B), who were scheduled for primary debulking surgery, without any contraindications for laparoscopy, laparotomy, or both.",
        "Index tests": "The evaluated test was an additional diagnostic laparoscopy, performed when a woman was recommended to have primary debulking surgery after standard diagnostic work\u2010up. Standard work\u2010up usually consisted of full physical and gynaecological examination, ultrasonography, serum cancer antigen 125 (CA\u2010125) and computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pelvic area, the abdomen and the thorax. A positive index test result means that the tumour was judged to be too extensively spread to be operated upon; a negative index test result means that the tumour, according to the laparoscopy, was not too extensive to be resected (Figure 2). Two by two table of index test results by reference standard outcomes. TP = True Positive, TN = True Negative, FP = False Positive, FN = False Negative",
        "Target conditions": "The target condition was deposits of ovarian cancer that could not be resected to at least < 1 cm (maximum diameter) at laparotomy and therefore making women unsuitable for primary debulking surgery. Examples of ovarian cancer deposits that cannot be resected include extensive peritoneal and mesenteric carcinomatoses (> 100 spots) or extensive metastases in the upper abdomen, such as bulky disease on the diaphragm or liver surfaces. The definition of ovarian cancer deposits that could not be resected at laparotomy was extracted from each study. Ideally, no macroscopic residual tumour is left after surgery (0 cm) to obtain the best survival, yet in the literature different cut\u2010off values are used for residual tumour (> 0 cm or > 1 cm), therefore we report both outcome values.",
        "Reference standards": "Laparotomy was the reference standard and allows complete exploration of the entire abdominal cavity and to locate all tumour deposits. The goal at laparotomy is to remove all macroscopic (visible) tumour, therefore representing a true impression of the resectability of ovarian cancer deposits in the abdominal cavity."
