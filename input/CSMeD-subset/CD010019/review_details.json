    "title": "Outpatient versus inpatient treatment for acute pulmonary embolism",
    "abstract": "Background Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common life\u2010threatening cardiovascular condition, with an incidence of 23 to 69 new cases per 100,000 people each year. For selected low\u2010risk patients with acute PE, outpatient treatment might provide several advantages over traditional inpatient treatment, such as reduction of hospitalisations, substantial cost savings, and improvements in health\u2010related quality of life. This is an update of an earlier Cochrane Review.    Objectives To assess the effects of outpatient versus inpatient treatment in low\u2010risk patients with acute PE.    Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 31 May 2021.    Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of outpatient versus inpatient treatment of adults (aged 18 years and over) diagnosed with low\u2010risk acute PE.    Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were short\u2010 and long\u2010term all\u2010cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were bleeding, adverse effects, recurrence of PE, and patient satisfaction. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.    Main results We did not identify any new studies for this update. We included a total of two RCTs involving 453 participants. Both trials discharged participants randomised to the outpatient group within 36 hours of initial triage, and both followed participants for 90 days. One study compared the same treatment regimens in both outpatient and inpatient groups, and the other study used different treatment regimens. There was no clear difference in treatment effect for the outcomes of mortality at 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 7.98; 2 studies, 453 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence), mortality at 90 days (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.58; 2 studies, 451 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence), major bleeding at 14 days (RR 4.91, 95% CI 0.24 to 101.57; 2 studies, 445 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) and at 90 days (RR 6.88, 95% CI 0.36 to 132.14; 2 studies, 445 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence), minor bleeding (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.79; 1 study, 106 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence), recurrent PE within 90 days (RR 2.95, 95% CI 0.12 to 71.85; 2 studies, 445 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence), and patient satisfaction (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.04; 2 studies, 444 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because the CIs were wide and included treatment effects in both directions, the sample sizes and numbers of events were small, and it was not possible to determine the effect of missing data or the presence of publication bias. The included studies did not assess PE\u2010related mortality or adverse effects, such as haemodynamic instability, or adherence to treatment.    Authors' conclusions Currently, only low\u2010certainty evidence is available from two published randomised controlled trials on outpatient versus inpatient treatment in low\u2010risk patients with acute PE. The studies did not provide evidence of any clear difference between the interventions in overall mortality, bleeding, or recurrence of PE.",

        "Types of studies": "This systematic review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) as well as quasi\u2010RCTs (in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods), as we did not anticipate finding many RCTs in this area.",
        "Types of participants": "We included adults (18 years and older) diagnosed with low\u2010risk acute pulmonary embolism (PE), defined as acute onset of dyspnoea or chest pain together with a new contrast\u2010filling defect on single\u2010 or multi\u2010detector computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography or pulmonary digital angiography, a new high\u2010probability ventilation\u2010perfusion lung scan or documentation of a new proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) either by venous ultrasonography or contrast venography. We considered people to be at low risk if they were classified as such by any validated or non\u2010validated measurement tool that aimed to classify mortality risk rate related to PE, such as the Geneva prediction score (GPS), the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI), the simplified PESI (sPESI), or the Hestia criteria.",
        "Types of interventions": "Intervention group: participants allocated to outpatient management for acute PE.   Control group: participants allocated to hospital (inpatient) management for acute PE. Intervention group: participants allocated to outpatient management for acute PE. Control group: participants allocated to hospital (inpatient) management for acute PE. We considered outpatients as people who were discharged within 36 hours after the low\u2010risk acute PE diagnosis and who then completed treatment as outpatients.",

Bleeding (from the date of randomisation to 90 days): we defined major bleeding as fatal or clinically overt bleeding resulting in fall of haemoglobin by 2 g/L or more, or bleeding into critical anatomical sites (subdural haematoma, intraspinal haemorrhage, retroperitoneal, intraocular, pericardial, atraumatic intra\u2010articular), or leading to transfusion of 2 U or more of blood or red cells (Schulman 2005). We defined minor bleeding as bleeding requiring intervention but not qualifying as a major bleeding, including bleeding precipitating treatment cessation (Schulman 2005).    Adverse effects, such as haemodynamic instability (from the date of randomisation to 90 days).    Recurrence of PE (from the date of randomisation to 90 days).
