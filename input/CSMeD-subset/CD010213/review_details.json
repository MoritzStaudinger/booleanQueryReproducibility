    "title": "Imaging modalities for characterising focal pancreatic lesions",
    "abstract": "Background Increasing numbers of incidental pancreatic lesions are being detected each year. Accurate characterisation of pancreatic lesions into benign, precancerous, and cancer masses is crucial in deciding whether to use treatment or surveillance. Distinguishing benign lesions from precancerous and cancerous lesions can prevent patients from undergoing unnecessary major surgery. Despite the importance of accurately classifying pancreatic lesions, there is no clear algorithm for management of focal pancreatic lesions.    Objectives To determine and compare the diagnostic accuracy of various imaging modalities in detecting cancerous and precancerous lesions in people with focal pancreatic lesions.    Search methods We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Science Citation Index until 19 July 2016. We searched the references of included studies to identify further studies. We did not restrict studies based on language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively.    Selection criteria We planned to include studies reporting cross\u2010sectional information on the index test (CT (computed tomography), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), PET (positron emission tomography), EUS (endoscopic ultrasound), EUS elastography, and EUS\u2010guided biopsy or FNA (fine\u2010needle aspiration)) and reference standard (confirmation of the nature of the lesion was obtained by histopathological examination of the entire lesion by surgical excision, or histopathological examination for confirmation of precancer or cancer by biopsy and clinical follow\u2010up of at least six months in people with negative index tests) in people with pancreatic lesions irrespective of language or publication status or whether the data were collected prospectively or retrospectively.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently searched the references to identify relevant studies and extracted the data. We planned to use the bivariate analysis to calculate the summary sensitivity and specificity with their 95% confidence intervals and the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) to compare the tests and assess heterogeneity, but used simpler models (such as univariate random\u2010effects model and univariate fixed\u2010effect model) for combining studies when appropriate because of the sparse data. We were unable to compare the diagnostic performance of the tests using formal statistical methods because of sparse data.    Main results We included 54 studies involving a total of 3,196 participants evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of various index tests. In these 54 studies, eight different target conditions were identified with different final diagnoses constituting benign, precancerous, and cancerous lesions. None of the studies was of high methodological quality. None of the comparisons in which single studies were included was of sufficiently high methodological quality to warrant highlighting of the results. For differentiation of cancerous lesions from benign or precancerous lesions, we identified only one study per index test. The second analysis, of studies differentiating cancerous versus benign lesions, provided three tests in which meta\u2010analysis could be performed. The sensitivities and specificities for diagnosing cancer were: EUS\u2010FNA: sensitivity 0.79 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 1.00), specificity 1.00 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.00); EUS: sensitivity 0.95 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.99), specificity 0.53 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.74); PET: sensitivity 0.92 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.97), specificity 0.65 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.84). The third analysis, of studies differentiating precancerous or cancerous lesions from benign lesions, only provided one test (EUS\u2010FNA) in which meta\u2010analysis was performed. EUS\u2010FNA had moderate sensitivity for diagnosing precancerous or cancerous lesions (sensitivity 0.73 (95% CI 0.01 to 1.00) and high specificity 0.94 (95% CI 0.15 to 1.00), the extremely wide confidence intervals reflecting the heterogeneity between the studies). The fourth analysis, of studies differentiating cancerous (invasive carcinoma) from precancerous (dysplasia) provided three tests in which meta\u2010analysis was performed. The sensitivities and specificities for diagnosing invasive carcinoma were: CT: sensitivity 0.72 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.87), specificity 0.92 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.97); EUS: sensitivity 0.78 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.94), specificity 0.91 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.98); EUS\u2010FNA: sensitivity 0.66 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.99), specificity 0.92 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.98). The fifth analysis, of studies differentiating cancerous (high\u2010grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma) versus precancerous (low\u2010 or intermediate\u2010grade dysplasia) provided six tests in which meta\u2010analysis was performed. The sensitivities and specificities for diagnosing cancer (high\u2010grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma) were: CT: sensitivity 0.87 (95% CI 0.00 to 1.00), specificity 0.96 (95% CI 0.00 to 1.00); EUS: sensitivity 0.86 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.92), specificity 0.91 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.96); EUS\u2010FNA: sensitivity 0.47 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.70), specificity 0.91 (95% CI 0.32 to 1.00); EUS\u2010FNA carcinoembryonic antigen 200 ng/mL: sensitivity 0.58 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.83), specificity 0.51 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.81); MRI: sensitivity 0.69 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.86), specificity 0.93 (95% CI 0.43 to 1.00); PET: sensitivity 0.90 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.96), specificity 0.94 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.99). The sixth analysis, of studies differentiating cancerous (invasive carcinoma) from precancerous (low\u2010grade dysplasia) provided no tests in which meta\u2010analysis was performed. The seventh analysis, of studies differentiating precancerous or cancerous (intermediate\u2010 or high\u2010grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma) from precancerous (low\u2010grade dysplasia) provided two tests in which meta\u2010analysis was performed. The sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing cancer were: CT: sensitivity 0.83 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.92), specificity 0.83 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.93) and MRI: sensitivity 0.80 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.92), specificity 0.81 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.95), respectively. The eighth analysis, of studies differentiating precancerous or cancerous (intermediate\u2010 or high\u2010grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma) from precancerous (low\u2010grade dysplasia) or benign lesions provided no test in which meta\u2010analysis was performed.  There were no major alterations in the subgroup analysis of cystic pancreatic focal lesions (42 studies; 2086 participants). None of the included studies evaluated EUS elastography or sequential testing.    Authors' conclusions We were unable to arrive at any firm conclusions because of the differences in the way that study authors classified focal pancreatic lesions into cancerous, precancerous, and benign lesions; the inclusion of few studies with wide confidence intervals for each comparison; poor methodological quality in the studies; and heterogeneity in the estimates within comparisons.",

There is no standard algorithm in the diagnosis or management of focal pancreatic lesions.

        "Reference standards": "We accepted the following reference standards. Histopathological examination of the entire lesion by surgical resection (gold standard). This classified the lesion as benign, precancerous, or cancerous.    Histopathological examination (irrespective of how the tissues were obtained for histopathological examination) in people with positive test (for cancerous or precancerous lesions) and clinical follow\u2010up by a doctor (with or without sequential follow\u2010up with imaging but using appropriate criteria such as metastases or confirmation of cancer by biopsy or death of participants due to cancer) of all participants with negative test for a period of at least six months and for a maximum period of 24 months. Until a definitive diagnosis is available, percutaneous biopsy is generally avoided because of the fear of seeding of cancer cells in potentially resectable cancers. As anticipated, the tissues obtained for histopathological examination were obtained from surgical resection. It is unlikely that patients with a low likelihood for cancer based on clinical symptoms and signs and test results (may include the results of index test) are subject to surgery or biopsy. Even if a biopsy is performed in such patients, a cancerous or precancerous lesion cannot be ruled out because of sampling error. Consequently, such patients are usually followed up clinically with sequential imaging. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma will cause clinical deterioration or increase in tumour size during a period of six months, and so we accepted clinical follow\u2010up or sequential follow\u2010up imaging (irrespective of the modality of the imaging) of all participants with a negative biopsy or no biopsy for at least six months as one of the reference standards. However, we accepted clinical follow\u2010up as a reference standard only when the criteria used for diagnosis were appropriate (e.g. identification of metastases, later biopsy of the lesion confirming the nature of the lesion, and death of participants due to cancer). The choice of a maximum period of 24 months was an arbitrary choice based on the low probability of precancerous lesions becoming cancerous during 24 months. Clinical follow\u2010up of patients is unlikely to classify precancerous lesions correctly since patients are unlikely to develop metastases or die within this interval. Histopathological examination of the entire lesion by surgical resection (gold standard). This classified the lesion as benign, precancerous, or cancerous.
