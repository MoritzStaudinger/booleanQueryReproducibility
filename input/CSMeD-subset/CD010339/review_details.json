    "title": "Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones",
    "abstract": "Background Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) are tests used in the diagnosis of common bile duct stones in people suspected of having common bile duct stones. There has been no systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of ERCP and IOC.    Objectives To determine and compare the accuracy of ERCP and IOC for the diagnosis of common bile duct stones.    Search methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, BIOSIS, and Clinicaltrials.gov to September 2012. To identify additional studies, we searched the references of included studies and systematic reviews identified from various databases (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE)), Health Technology Assessment (HTA), Medion, and ARIF (Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility)). We did not restrict studies based on language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively.    Selection criteria We included studies that provided the number of true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives for ERCP or IOC. We only accepted studies that confirmed the presence of common bile duct stones by extraction of the stones (irrespective of whether this was done by surgical or endoscopic methods) for a positive test, and absence of common bile duct stones by surgical or endoscopic negative exploration of the common bile duct, or symptom\u2010free follow\u2010up for at least six months for a negative test as the reference standard in people suspected of having common bile duct stones. We included participants with or without prior diagnosis of cholelithiasis; with or without symptoms and complications of common bile duct stones; with or without prior treatment for common bile duct stones; and before or after cholecystectomy. At least two authors screened abstracts and selected studies for inclusion independently.    Data collection and analysis Two authors independently collected data from each study. We used the bivariate model to summarise the sensitivity and specificity of the tests.    Main results We identified five studies including 318 participants (180 participants with and 138 participants without common bile duct stones) that reported the diagnostic accuracy of ERCP and five studies including 654 participants (125 participants with and 529 participants without common bile duct stones) that reported the diagnostic accuracy of IOC. Most studies included people with symptoms (participants with jaundice or pancreatitis) suspected of having common bile duct stones based on blood tests, ultrasound, or both, prior to the performance of ERCP or IOC. Most studies included participants who had not previously undergone removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy). None of the included studies was of high methodological quality as evaluated by the QUADAS\u20102 tool (quality assessment tool for diagnostic accuracy studies). The sensitivities of ERCP ranged between 0.67 and 0.94 and the specificities ranged between 0.92 and 1.00. For ERCP, the summary sensitivity was 0.83 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.90) and specificity was 0.99 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.00). The sensitivities of IOC ranged between 0.75 and 1.00 and the specificities ranged between 0.96 and 1.00. For IOC, the summary sensitivity was 0.99 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.00) and specificity was 0.99 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.00). For ERCP, at the median pre\u2010test probability of common bile duct stones of 0.35 estimated from the included studies (i.e., 35% of people suspected of having common bile duct stones were confirmed to have gallstones by the reference standard), the post\u2010test probabilities associated with positive test results was 0.97 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.99) and negative test results was 0.09 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.14). For IOC, at the median pre\u2010test probability of common bile duct stones of 0.35, the post\u2010test probabilities associated with positive test results was 0.98 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.00) and negative test results was 0.01 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.10). There was weak evidence of a difference in sensitivity (P value = 0.05) with IOC showing higher sensitivity than ERCP. There was no evidence of a difference in specificity (P value = 0.7) with both tests having similar specificity.    Authors' conclusions Although the sensitivity of IOC appeared to be better than that of ERCP, this finding may be unreliable because none of the studies compared both tests in the same study populations and most of the studies were methodologically flawed. It appears that both tests were fairly accurate in guiding further invasive treatment as most people diagnosed with common bile duct stones by these tests had common bile duct stones. Some people may have common bile duct stones in spite of having a negative ERCP or IOC result. Such people may have to be re\u2010tested if the clinical suspicion of common bile duct stones is very high because of their symptoms or persistently abnormal liver function tests. However, the results should be interpreted with caution given the limited quantity and quality of the evidence.",

        "Types of studies": "We included studies providing cross\u2010sectional information comparing one or more of the index tests against a reference standard in the appropriate patient population (see Participants). We included studies irrespective of language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively. We included comparative studies in which ERCP and IOC were performed in the same study population either by giving all participants both index tests or by randomly allocating participants to receive ERCP or IOC. We excluded diagnostic case\u2010control studies if there were at least four cross\u2010sectional or comparative studies.",

        "Reference standards": "We accepted the following reference standard. For test positives, we accepted confirmation of a common bile duct stone by extraction of the stone (irrespective of whether this was done by surgical or endoscopic methods).    For test negatives, we acknowledged that there was no way of being sure that there were no common bile duct stones. However, we accepted negative results by surgical or endoscopic negative exploration of the common bile duct, or symptom\u2010free follow\u2010up for at least six months as the reference standard. Surgical or endoscopic exploration s adequate, but it is not commonly used in people with negative index tests because of its invasive nature. Therefore, we accepted follow\u2010up as a less adequate reference test. Negative exploration of common bile duct is likely to be a better reference standard than follow\u2010up for at least six months since most stones already present in the common bile duct are likely to be extracted in this fashion. Six months is an arbitrary choice, but we anticipated most common bile duct stones will become manifest during this period.
