    "title": "11C\u2010PIB\u2010PET for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)",
    "abstract": "Background According to the latest revised National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (now known as the Alzheimer's Association) (NINCDS\u2010ADRDA) diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease dementia, the confidence in diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease dementia is raised with the application of imaging biomarkers. These tests, added to core clinical criteria, might increase the sensitivity or specificity of a testing strategy. However, the accuracy of biomarkers in the diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease dementia and other dementias has not yet been systematically evaluated. A formal systematic evaluation of the sensitivity, specificity, and other properties of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the 11C\u2010labelled Pittsburgh Compound\u2010B (11C\u2010PIB) ligand was performed.    Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the 11C\u2010 PIB\u2010PET scan for detecting participants with MCI at baseline who will clinically convert to Alzheimer\u2019s disease dementia or other forms of dementia over a period of time.    Search methods The most recent search for this review was performed on 12 January 2013. We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), BIOSIS Previews (ISI Web of Knowledge), Web of Science and Conference Proceedings (ISI Web of Knowledge), PsycINFO (OvidSP), and LILACS (BIREME). We also requested a search of the Cochrane Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (managed by the Cochrane Renal Group).  No language or date restrictions were applied to the electronic searches and methodological filters were not used so as to maximise sensitivity.    Selection criteria We selected studies that had prospectively defined cohorts with any accepted definition of MCI with baseline 11C\u2010PIB\u2010PET scan. In addition, we only selected studies that applied a reference standard for Alzheimer's dementia diagnosis for example NINCDS\u2010ADRDA or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\u2010IV (DSM\u2010IV) criteria.    Data collection and analysis We screened all titles generated by electronic database searches. Two review authors independently assessed the abstracts of all potentially relevant studies. The identified full papers were assessed for eligibility and data were extracted to create two by two tables. Two independent assessors performed quality assessment using the QUADAS 2 tool. We used the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) model to produce a summary ROC curve.    Main results Conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease dementia was evaluated in nine studies. The quality of the evidence was limited. Of the 274 participants included in the meta\u2010analysis, 112 developed Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. Based on the nine included studies, the median proportion converting was 34%. The studies varied markedly in how the PIB scans were done and interpreted.  The sensitivities were between 83% and 100% while the specificities were between 46% and 88%. Because of the variation in thresholds and measures of 11C\u2010PIB amyloid retention, we did not calculate summary sensitivity and specificity. Although subject to considerable uncertainty, to illustrate the potential strengths and weaknesses of 11C\u2010PIB\u2010PET scans we estimated from the fitted summary ROC curve that the sensitivity was 96% (95% confidence interval (CI) 87 to 99) at the included study median specificity of 58%. This equated to a positive likelihood ratio of 2.3 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.07. Assuming a typical conversion rate of MCI to Alzheimer\u2019s dementia of 34%, for every 100 PIB scans one person with a negative scan would progress and 28 with a positive scan would not actually progress to Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.  There were limited data for formal investigation of heterogeneity. We performed two sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of type of reference standard and the use of a pre\u2010specified threshold. There was no effect on our findings.    Authors' conclusions Although the good sensitivity achieved in some included studies is promising for the value of 11C\u2010PIB\u2010PET, given the heterogeneity in the conduct and interpretation of the test and the lack of defined thresholds for determination of test positivity, we cannot recommend its routine use in clinical practice.11C\u2010PIB\u2010PET biomarker is a high cost investigation, therefore it is important to clearly demonstrate its accuracy and standardise the process of the 11C\u2010PIB diagnostic modality prior to it being widely used.",

        "Types of studies": "We considered longitudinal studies that had prospectively defined cohorts with any accepted definition of MCI with baseline 11C\u2010PIB\u2010PET scan and the reference standard results obtained at follow\u2010up (see Index tests and Reference standards below). These studies necessarily employ delayed verification of conversion to dementia and are sometimes labelled as 'delayed verification cross\u2010sectional studies' (Knotnerus 2002; Bossuyt 2008). We included case control studies when they incorporated a delayed verification design. This occurred in the context of a cohort study, so these studies are invariably diagnostic nested case\u2010control studies.",
        "Participants": "Participants recruited and clinically classified as those with MCI at baseline were eligible for this review.\u00a0The diagnosis of MCI was established using the Petersen criteria\u00a0or revised Petersen criteria (Petersen 1999; Petersen 2004; Winblad 2004), the Matthews 2008 criteria, or CDR = 0.5 (Morris 1993), or a combination.\u00a0These criteria include: subjective complaints; a decline in memory objectively verified by neuropsychological testing in combination with a history from the patient; a decline in other cognitive domains; no or minimal impairment of activities of daily living; not meeting the criteria for dementia. Therefore, the eligible participants had a number of tests, for example neuropsychological tests for cognitive deficit and checklists for activities of daily living, prior to study entry. Participants in some studies were defined as amnestic single domain, amnestic multiple domain, non\u2010amnestic single domain, non\u2010amnestic multiple domain, or non\u2010specified MCI participants. We considered these studies for inclusion. We also considered studies without reference to a particular source of recruitment (participant setting) for inclusion. We excluded studies that involved patients with MCI possibly caused by: i) current or a history of alcohol or drug abuse; ii) central nervous system (CNS) trauma (for example subdural haematoma), tumour, or infection; iii) other neurological conditions (for example Parkinson\u2019s or Huntington\u2019s diseases).",
        "Index tests": "11C\u2010PIB\u2010PET imaging test We used the criteria that were applied in each included primary study to classify participants as either 11C\u2010PIB positive or 11C\u2010PIB negative. We considered positivity as 11C\u2010PIB ligand uptake and retention exceeding a certain threshold.",
        "Target conditions": "There were two target conditions in this review: Alzheimer\u2019s disease dementia (ADD) (conversion from MCI to ADD);   Any other forms of dementia (conversion from MCI to any other forms of dementia). Alzheimer\u2019s disease dementia (ADD) (conversion from MCI to ADD); Any other forms of dementia (conversion from MCI to any other forms of dementia).",
        "Reference standards": "The reference standard was progression to the target conditions. For the purpose of this review, several definitions of ADD were acceptable.\u00a0Included studies applied probable or possible National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (now known as the Alzheimer's Association) (NINCDS\u2010ADRDA) criteria (McKhann 1984).\u00a0The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (DSMIII 1987; DSMIV 1994) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (World Health Organization 2010) definitions for ADD were also acceptable. Similarly, differing clinical definitions of other dementias were acceptable.\u00a0For Lewy body dementia the reference standard is the McKeith criteria (McKeith 1996; McKeith 2005); for frontotemporal dementia (FTD) the Lund criteria (Neary 1988; Brun 1994; Boxer 2005), DSM (DSMIII 1987; DSMIV 1994), ICD (World Health Organization 2010); and for vascular dementia the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Association Internationale pour la Recherch\u00e9 et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS ARIEN) criteria (Roman 1993), DSM (DSMIII 1987; DSMIV 1994), and ICD (World Health Organization 2010). The time interval over which progression from MCI to ADD or other forms of dementia occurred is very important. We chose one year as the minimum period of delay in the verification of the diagnosis (that is the time between the assessment at which a diagnosis of MCI is made and the assessment at which the diagnosis of dementia is made). We planned to segment analyses into separate follow\u2010up mean periods for the delay in verification: one year to less than two years; two to less than four years; and greater than four years.\u00a0In this eventuality we planned to clearly note where the same included studies contributed to the analysis for more than one reference standard follow\u2010up interval."

In assessing individual items, the score of unclear should only be given if there is genuine uncertainty.\u00a0 In these situations review authors will contact the relevant study teams for additional information.  Table 5: Anchoring statements to assist with assessment for risk of bias        Question    Response and weighting    Explanation      Patient Selection      Was the sampling method appropriate?   No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias   Where sampling is used, the designs least likely to cause bias are consecutive sampling or random sampling. Sampling that is based on volunteers or selecting subjects from a clinic or research resource is prone to bias.      Was a case\u2010control or similar design avoided?   No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias   Designs similar to case control that may introduce bias are those designs where the study team deliberately increase or decrease the proportion of subjects with the target condition, which may not be representative. Some case control methods may already be excluded if they mix subjects from various settings.      Are exclusion criteria described and appropriate?   No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias   Study will be automatically graded unclear if exclusions are not detailed (pending contact with study authors). Where exclusions are detailed, the study will be graded as \u201clow risk\u201d if exclusions are felt to be appropriate by the review authors. Certain exclusions common to many studies of dementia are: medical instability; terminal disease; alcohol/substance misuse; concomitant psychiatric diagnosis; other neurodegenerative condition. Exclusions are not felt to be appropriate if \u2018difficult to diagnose\u2019 patients are excluded. Post hoc and inappropriate exclusions will be labelled \u201chigh risk\u201d of bias.      Index Test      Was PIB\u2010PET biomarker's assessment / interpretation performed without knowledge of clinical dementia diagnosis?    No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias   Terms such as \u201cblinded\u201d or \u201cindependently and without knowledge of\u201d are sufficient and full details of the blinding procedure are not required. Interpretation of the results of the index test may be influenced by knowledge of the results of reference standard. If the index test is always interpreted prior to the reference standard then the person interpreting the index test cannot be aware of the results of the reference standard and so this item could be rated as \u2018yes\u2019.  For certain index tests the result is objective and knowledge of reference standard should not influence result, for example level of protein in cerebrospinal fluid, in this instance the quality assessment may be \u201clow risk\u201d even if blinding was not achieved.      Were PIB\u2010PET biomarker's thresholds pre\u2010specified?   No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias   For scales and biomarkers there is often a reference point (in units or categories) above which subjects are classified as \u201ctest positive\u201d; this may be referred to as threshold; clinical cut\u2010off or dichotomisation point. A study is classified high risk of bias if the authors define the optimal cut\u2010off post\u2010hoc based on their own study data because selecting the threshold to maximise sensitivity and / specificity may lead to overoptimistic measures of test performance.  Certain papers may use an alternative methodology for analysis that does not use thresholds and these papers should be classified as not applicable.      Reference Standard      Is the assessment used for clinical diagnosis of dementia acceptable?   No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias   Commonly used international criteria to assist with clinical diagnosis of dementia include those detailed in DSM\u2010IV and ICD\u201010. Criteria specific to dementia subtypes include but are not limited to NINCDS\u2010ADRDA criteria for Alzheimer\u2019s dementia; McKeith criteria for Lewy Body dementia; Lund criteria for frontotemporal dementia; and the NINDS\u2010AIREN criteria for vascular dementia. Where the criteria used for assessment is not familiar to the review authors or the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement group (\u2018unclear\u2019) this item should be classified as \u201chigh risk of bias\u201d.      Was clinical assessment for dementia performed without knowledge of the PIB\u2010PET biomarker?   No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias   Terms such as \u201cblinded\u201d or \u201cindependently and without knowledge of\u201d are sufficient and full details of the blinding procedure are not required. Interpretation of the results of the reference standard may be influenced by knowledge of the results of index test.      Patient flow      Was there an appropriate interval between PIB\u2010PET biomarker and clinical dementia assessment?    No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias   As we test the accuracy of the PIB\u2010PET biomarker for MCI conversion to dementia, there will always be a delay between the index test and the reference standard assessments. The time between reference standard and index test will influence the accuracy (Geslani 2005;Okello 2009;Visser 2006), and therefore we will note time as a separate variable (both within and between studies) and will test its influence on the diagnostic accuracy. We have set a minimum mean time to follow\u2010up assessment of 1 year. If more than 16% of subjects of subjects have assessment for MCI conversion before nine months this item will score \u2018no\u2019.      Did all subjects get the same assessment for dementia regardless PIB\u2010PET biomarker?   No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias   There may be scenarios where subjects who score \u201ctest positive\u201d on index test have a more detailed assessment. Where dementia assessment differs between subjects this should be classified as high risk of bias.      Were all patients who received PIB\u2010PET biomarker's assessment included in the final analysis?    No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias   If the number of patients enrolled differs from the number of patients included in the 2X2 table then there is the potential for bias. If patients lost to drop\u2010outs differ systematically from those who remain, then estimates of test performance may differ.  If drop outs these should be accounted for; a maximum proportion of drop outs to remain low risk of bias has been specified as 20%      Were missing PIB\u2010PET biomarker results reported?   No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias   Where missing or uninterpretable results are reported, and if there is substantial attrition (we have set an arbitrary value of 50% missing data), this should be scored as \u2018no\u2019. If those results are not reported, this should be scored as \u2018unclear\u2019 and authors will be contacted      Anchoring statements to assist with assessment for applicability      Question    Explanation      Were included patients representative of the general population of interest?   The included patients should match the intended population as described in the review question. The review authors should consider population in terms of symptoms; pre\u2010testing; potential disease prevalence; setting  If there is a clear ground for suspecting an unrepresentative spectrum the item should be rated poor applicability.      Index test      Were sufficient data on Plasma and PIB\u2010PET biomarker's application given for the test to be repeated in an independent study?    Variation in technology, test execution, and test interpretation may affect estimate of accuracy. In addition, the background, and training/expertise of the assessor should be reported and taken in consideration. If PIB\u2010PET biomarker was not performed consistently this item should be rated poor applicability.      Reference Standard      Was clinical diagnosis of dementia made in a manner similar to current clinical practice?   For many reviews, inclusion criteria and assessment for risk of bias will already have assessed the dementia diagnosis. For certain reviews an applicability statement relating to reference standard may not be applicable. There is the possibility that a form of dementia assessment, although valid, may diagnose a far larger proportion of subjects with disease than usual clinical practice. In this instance the item should be rated poor applicability."
