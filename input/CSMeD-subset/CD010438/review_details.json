    "title": "Thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) for trauma\u2011induced coagulopathy in adult trauma patients with bleeding",
    "abstract": "Background Trauma\u2010induced coagulopathy (TIC) is a disorder of the blood clotting process that occurs soon after trauma injury. A diagnosis of TIC on admission is associated with increased mortality rates, increased burdens of transfusion, greater risks of complications and longer stays in critical care. Current diagnostic testing follows local hospital processes and normally involves conventional coagulation tests including prothrombin time ratio/international normalized ratio (PTr/INR), activated partial prothrombin time and full blood count. In some centres, thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) are standard tests, but in the UK they are more commonly used in research settings.    Objectives The objective was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) for TIC in adult trauma patients with bleeding, using a reference standard of prothrombin time ratio and/or the international normalized ratio.    Search methods We ran the search on 4 March 2013. Searches ran from 1970 to current. We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE Classic and EMBASE, eleven other databases, the web, and clinical trials registers. The Cochrane Injuries Group's specialised register was not searched for this review as it does not contain diagnostic test accuracy studies. We also screened reference lists, conducted forward citation searches and contacted authors.    Selection criteria We included all cross\u2010sectional studies investigating the diagnostic test accuracy of TEG and ROTEM in patients with clinically suspected TIC, as well as case\u2010control studies. Participants were adult trauma patients in both military and civilian settings. TIC was defined as a PTr/INR reading of 1.2 or greater, or 1.5 or greater.    Data collection and analysis We piloted and performed all review stages in duplicate, including quality assessment using the QUADAS\u20102 tool, adhering to guidance in the Cochrane Handbook for Diagnostic Test Accuracy Reviews. We analysed sensitivity and specificity of included studies narratively as there were insufficient studies to perform a meta\u2010analysis.    Main results Three studies were included in the final analysis. All three studies used ROTEM as the test of global haemostatic function, and none of the studies used TEG. Tissue factor\u2010activated assay EXTEM clot amplitude (CA) was the focus of the accuracy measurements in blood samples taken near to the point of admission. These CAs were not taken at a uniform time after the start of the coagulopathic trace; the time varied from five minutes, to ten minutes and fifteen minutes. The three included studies were conducted in the UK, France and Afghanistan in both civilian and military trauma settings. In two studies, median Injury Severity Scores were 12, inter\u2010quartile range (IQR) 4 to 24; and 22, IQR 12 to 34; and in one study the median New Injury Severity Score was 34, IQR 17 to 43.  There were insufficient included studies examining each of the three ROTEM CAs at 5, 10 and 15 minutes to make meta\u2010analysis and investigation of heterogeneity valid. The results of the included studies are thus reported narratively and illustrated by a forest plot and results plotted on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plane.  For CA5 the accuracy results were sensitivity 70% (95% CI 47% to 87%) and specificity 86% (95% CI 82% to 90%) for one study, and sensitivity 96% (95% CI 88% to 100%) and specificity 58% (95% CI 44% to 72%) for the other.  For CA10 the accuracy results were sensitivity 100% (95% CI 94% to 100%) and specificity 70% (95% CI 56% to 82%).  For CA15 the accuracy results were sensitivity 88% (95% CI 69% to 97%) and specificity 100% (95% CI 94% to 100%).  No uninterpretable ROTEM study results were mentioned in any of the included studies. Risk of bias and concerns around applicability of findings was low across all studies for the patient and flow and timing domains. However, risk of bias and concerns around applicability of findings for the index test domain was either high or unclear, and the risk of bias for the reference standard domain was high. This raised concerns around the interpretation of the sensitivity and specificity results of the included studies, which may be misleading.    Authors' conclusions We found no evidence on the accuracy of TEG and very little evidence on the accuracy of ROTEM. The value of accuracy estimates are considerably undermined by the small number of included studies, and concerns about risk of bias relating to the index test and the reference standard. We recognise that the reference standards of PT and INR are imperfect, but in the absence of embedded clinical consensus these are judged to be the best reflection of current clinical practice. We are unable to offer advice on the use of global measures of haemostatic function for trauma based on the evidence on test accuracy identified in this systematic review. This evidence strongly suggests that at present these tests should only be used for research. We consider more thoroughly what this research could be in the Discussion section.",

        "Types of studies": "We included all cross\u2010sectional studies investigating the diagnostic test accuracy of TEG or ROTEM in patients with clinically suspected TIC. We would have included case\u2010control studies due to the small number of cross\u2010sectional studies retrieved, but we found none.",
        "Participants": "We included all studies involving adult trauma patients with clinically suspected TIC in both military and civilian settings.",
        "Index tests": "This review focused on two global tests of haemostatic function; TEG (thromboelastography \u2010 trademark of the Haemonetics Corporation, USA) and ROTEM (rotational thromboelastometry \u2010 trademark of TEM International GmbH). Thresholds are indicated in Table 1.",
        "Target conditions": "The target condition was TIC defined by standard clotting times of prothrombin time ratio (PTr) and international normalized ratio (INR).",
        "Reference standards": "In the absence of embedded clinical consensus, we used a coagulopathic range based on PTr/INR; the lower limit of the coagulopathic range being a PTr/INR reading of 1.2 or greater (Frith 2010), and the higher limit of the coagulopathic range being a PTr/INR reading of 1.5 or greater (Stainsby 2006). There is no upper threshold: anyone with a PTr/INR count of above 1.2, or above 1.5, is considered coagulopathic. These figures were reached through discussion by the report authors, including experts in haematology and trauma medicine. PTr differs from INR, although the final numbers may be the same. The PTr calculated varies according to local thresholds and separate batches of different manufacturers' reagent involved in conducting the prothrombin time test. In an effort to standardise this measurement, the INR is calculated as the ratio of a patient\u2019s PTr compared to a mean normal PTr (calculated by determining the mean of 30 or more patients who are representative of the local hospital population), computed to the power of the International Sensitivity Index (ISI), which is itself calculated by the manufacturer, to give an indication of how each batch of tissue factor corresponds to an international reference. The equation for calculation is shown in Figure 2. INR equation"

        "Appendix 3. Methods from protocol [Art. No.: CD010438]": "Methods   Criteria for considering studies for this review   Types of studies Cross\u2010sectional studies investigating the diagnostic test accuracy of TEG or ROTEM in patients with clinically suspected TIC will be eligible. We will expand the inclusion criteria to include case control studies if the number of sources retrieved is insufficient for a valid systematic review and possible meta\u2010analysis. Pragmatically we have set this level at less than 100 patients in total in the included studies.    Participants All studies including adult trauma patients with clinically suspected TIC will be eligible. Studies in both military and civilian settings will be included.    Index tests Two global tests of haemostatic function will be used, TEG (thromboelastography \u2010 whose name is a trademark of the Haemoscope Corporation, USA http://www.haemoscope.com/) and ROTEM (rotational thromboelastometry \u2010 trademark of TEM International GmbH http://www.rotem.de/site/index.php). Normal thresholds are indicated in Table 1.    Target conditions The target condition will be TIC defined by standard clotting times of PTr and INR.   Reference standards In the absence of embedded clinical consensus, the coagulopathic range we will be using is based on pro\u2010thrombin time ratio (PTr)/International Normalized Ratio (INR), with the lower limit of the range a PTr/INR reading of 1.2 or greater Frith 2010), and the upper limit of 1.5 or greater (Stainsby 2006). There is no upper limit to the range \u2013 anyone with a PTr/INR count of above 1.2, or above 1.5, is considered coagulopathic. These figures were reached through discussion by the report authors, including experts in haematology and trauma medicine.  PTr differs from INR, although the final numbers may be the same. The PTr calculated varies depending on local thresholds and separate batches of different manufacturer\u2019s reagent involved in conducting the prothrombin time (PT) test. In an effort to standardise this measurement, the INR is calculated as the ratio of a patient\u2019s prothrombin time compared to a mean normal PT (calculated by determining the mean of 30 or more patients who are representative of the local hospital population), computed to the power of the International Sensitivity Index (ISI), which is itself calculated by the manufacturer to give an indication of how each batch of tissue factor corresponds to an international reference. The equation for calculation is in Figure 1.    Search methods for identification of studies A sensitive search strategy will be used to identify literature relating to the index test for this review. This strategy will not be limited by language but will be limited by date to 1990\u2010current and to human only populations. The test technology has been established since 1948, but the date limit has been set to 1990 in order to maximise study quality and capture the more recent versions of the technology in current use.    Electronic searches The following bibliographic resources will be searched: British Nursing Index, Biosis, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, Conference Proceedings Citation Index\u2010 Science (CPCI\u2010S), Conference Proceedings Citation Index\u2010 Social Science & Humanities (CPCI\u2010SSH), EMBASE, HMIC, MEDLINE in Process, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI\u2010EXPANDED), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), LILACS and the Transfusion Evidence Library.  The following trials registers will be hand\u2010searched: Current Controlled Trials, Clinical Trials.Gov and the WHO International Trials Registry Platform via http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/  The following websites will be searched:    Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility (ARIF) via http://tinyurl.com/3u9tevp    C\u2010EBLM   Diagnostic Test Accuracy Working Group (Cochrane) via http://srdta.cochrane.org/    Google   MEDION database via http://www.mediondatabase.nl/    http://srdta.cochrane.org/    Haemonetics Corporation http://www.haemoscope.com/    TEM Innovations GmbH http://www.rotem.de/site/index.php       Searching other resources Citation chasing will be conducted on all studies included on full text. Attempts will be made to conduct authors for any additional or supporting information. For further details on the search, including the strategy, please see Appendix 2.    Data collection and analysis   Selection of studies All sources will be managed using Review Manager 5 software. The inclusion criteria will be based on the \u201cCriteria for considering the studies for this review\u201d detailed above. Decisions on inclusion/exclusion of studies will be made independently by two reviewers (HH and CH) using piloted criteria. Disagreements will be resolved with reference to a third experienced reviewer (SS and PP). The systematic review of diagnostic test accuracy of coagulation tests will target prospective cohort studies measuring accuracy relative to a reference standard and rigorous evaluation of time taken to obtain coagulation results.    Data extraction and management We will extract the following data (where available) into a bespoke data extraction table.     Author, year of study, year of publication, journal reference.   Study design and timing of data collection (prospective/retrospective).   Study population and participant characteristics (age, sex, setting \u2013 e.g. hospital, region, country, other details given).    Trauma type and severity (Injury Severity Score \u2013 ISS).   Patient history.   Pre\u2010admission treatment, especially blood transfusion and/or additives.   Blood temperature and duration of bleed at point of testing.   Reference test used (PTr/INR) and any other measures taken (e.g. PT, APTT, Fibrinogen level, platelet count, fibrinogen degradation products).    Index test used (TEG/ROTEM) and version of device.   Any details about device reliability.   When tests were carried out in treatment phase (i.e. pre/post transfusion, timings).   Data from the 2 x 2 table will be extracted where presented, i.e. true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives.    QUADAS\u20102 items (see Table 2).     Where available, variability between operators and assay conditions will be recorded. Particular care is likely to be required on many of these items (index test and reference standard) because of lack of standardisation. The abstraction form will be piloted by two authors (HH and CH) using two primary diagnostic studies. A third author (NC) will resolve disagreements. The form will be accompanied by a briefing document explaining how it should be used. Data will be abstracted by one reviewer (HH) and checked by a second (CH), with a third author (NC) providing moderation as required.    Assessment of methodological quality Quality assessment will be carried out using a checklist approach to assess the quality of primary studies based on the QUADAS\u20102 instrument (see Table 2) in line with advice given in Chapter 9, \u2018Assessing Methodological Quality\u2019 in the Cochrane Handbook for Diagnostic Test Accuracy Reviews (Reitsma 2009). We will independently score each item as \u2018Yes\u2019, \u2018No\u2019 or \u2018Unclear\u2019, and will omit three reporting items from the QUADAS\u20102 list, addressing the description of the index test, reference standard and selection criteria, as recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Diagnostic Test Accuracy (Deeks 2010). A categorisation of 'unclear' will generally be considered a marker of poor quality, so care will be taken to account for the possibility that failing to report an item was reasonable given the circumstances in which the study was conducted. Results will be presented narratively in the text, and in an appropriate graphic representation of quality assessment (such as a table).    Statistical analysis and data synthesis We will consider the accuracy of TEG and ROTEM compared to the reference standard as detailed above. Results will be the components of the 2 x 2 table, sensitivity and specificity and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). These will be tabulated and presented graphically (forest plots and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space). The initial approach to analysis is likely to be qualitative, with conclusions based on patterns of results. Quantitative meta\u2010analysis may be appropriate where the quantity and nature of the included studies permit. If meta\u2010analysis is possible, the approach will be to calculate a summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve using a hierarchical SROC (HSROC) model. Use of a bivariate model will also be considered depending on the data (Reitsma 2009), but a priori uncertainty about thresholds and the likelihood of implicit thresholds suggests the HSROC model may be slightly preferable in the first instance. A summary of results table will be generated. If feasible and appropriate, translation of any summary results into natural frequencies and other metrics such as predictive values will be considered to facilitate improved understanding to readers.  The number of uninterpretable results will be tabulated and commented on. Analysis and presentation of results will be carried out in line with advice in Chapter 10 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy (Macaskill 2010).  We will carefully scrutinise all the included studies for any further investigation of discrepant results between the index test and reference standards (False Positives \u2013 FP \u2010 and False Negatives \u2010 FN), ideally based on independent clinical review of all available findings with the purpose of considering whether it was global haemostatic function or traditional measures of clotting which was giving the better indication of true disease state. Any results will tabulated and summarised narratively.    Investigations of heterogeneity With respect to test accuracy results, we will assume that important heterogeneity beyond that accounted for by chance will be present and will need to be investigated. Our initial approach will be to perform sequential sub\u2010group analyses using the analytical framework detailed below. We will consider whether using co\u2010variates in the HSROC model will add to any insights gained from these sub\u2010group analyses.  The provisional framework for investigating heterogeneity will include the following.    Type of global measure of haemostatic function (TEG/ROTEM).   Time blood sample taken relative to trauma (< 1 h/> 1 h).   Nature of reference standard (INR/PTr of 1.2 \u2265; INR/PTr of 1.5 \u2265).   Prevalence of acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC; excluding case\u2010control studies if these are included).    Participant type especially severity of trauma and mechanism of injury (blunt/penetrating).   Setting (military or civilian).   Whether trauma associated with massive transfusion (yes or mixed/no).   Case\u2010control study design (if these are included).   Other aspects of study quality, particularly blinding of index test and reference standard.     There are no specific plans for the investigation of heterogeneity of the data concerning uninterpretable results or further investigation of discrepant results.    Sensitivity analyses In the unlikely event that heterogeneity is not present and the effect of important covariates has not already been analysed, we will investigate the robustness of any summary estimates of test accuracy to the aspects of study quality indicated in the framework for investigating heterogeneity above.    Assessment of reporting bias We will not be assessing reporting bias because its impact in test accuracy is unclear and the tools for investigating it are in the early stages of development.",
        "Methods": "",
        "Criteria for considering studies for this review": "",
        "Types of studies": "Cross\u2010sectional studies investigating the diagnostic test accuracy of TEG or ROTEM in patients with clinically suspected TIC will be eligible. We will expand the inclusion criteria to include case control studies if the number of sources retrieved is insufficient for a valid systematic review and possible meta\u2010analysis. Pragmatically we have set this level at less than 100 patients in total in the included studies.",
        "Participants": "All studies including adult trauma patients with clinically suspected TIC will be eligible. Studies in both military and civilian settings will be included.",
        "Index tests": "Two global tests of haemostatic function will be used, TEG (thromboelastography \u2010 whose name is a trademark of the Haemoscope Corporation, USA http://www.haemoscope.com/) and ROTEM (rotational thromboelastometry \u2010 trademark of TEM International GmbH http://www.rotem.de/site/index.php). Normal thresholds are indicated in Table 1.",
        "Target conditions": "The target condition will be TIC defined by standard clotting times of PTr and INR.",
        "Reference standards": "In the absence of embedded clinical consensus, the coagulopathic range we will be using is based on pro\u2010thrombin time ratio (PTr)/International Normalized Ratio (INR), with the lower limit of the range a PTr/INR reading of 1.2 or greater Frith 2010), and the upper limit of 1.5 or greater (Stainsby 2006). There is no upper limit to the range \u2013 anyone with a PTr/INR count of above 1.2, or above 1.5, is considered coagulopathic. These figures were reached through discussion by the report authors, including experts in haematology and trauma medicine.  PTr differs from INR, although the final numbers may be the same. The PTr calculated varies depending on local thresholds and separate batches of different manufacturer\u2019s reagent involved in conducting the prothrombin time (PT) test. In an effort to standardise this measurement, the INR is calculated as the ratio of a patient\u2019s prothrombin time compared to a mean normal PT (calculated by determining the mean of 30 or more patients who are representative of the local hospital population), computed to the power of the International Sensitivity Index (ISI), which is itself calculated by the manufacturer to give an indication of how each batch of tissue factor corresponds to an international reference. The equation for calculation is in Figure 1.",
        "Search methods for identification of studies": "A sensitive search strategy will be used to identify literature relating to the index test for this review. This strategy will not be limited by language but will be limited by date to 1990\u2010current and to human only populations. The test technology has been established since 1948, but the date limit has been set to 1990 in order to maximise study quality and capture the more recent versions of the technology in current use.",
        "Electronic searches": "The following bibliographic resources will be searched: British Nursing Index, Biosis, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, Conference Proceedings Citation Index\u2010 Science (CPCI\u2010S), Conference Proceedings Citation Index\u2010 Social Science & Humanities (CPCI\u2010SSH), EMBASE, HMIC, MEDLINE in Process, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI\u2010EXPANDED), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), LILACS and the Transfusion Evidence Library.  The following trials registers will be hand\u2010searched: Current Controlled Trials, Clinical Trials.Gov and the WHO International Trials Registry Platform via http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/  The following websites will be searched:    Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility (ARIF) via http://tinyurl.com/3u9tevp    C\u2010EBLM   Diagnostic Test Accuracy Working Group (Cochrane) via http://srdta.cochrane.org/    Google   MEDION database via http://www.mediondatabase.nl/    http://srdta.cochrane.org/    Haemonetics Corporation http://www.haemoscope.com/    TEM Innovations GmbH http://www.rotem.de/site/index.php",
        "Searching other resources": "Citation chasing will be conducted on all studies included on full text. Attempts will be made to conduct authors for any additional or supporting information. For further details on the search, including the strategy, please see Appendix 2.",
        "Data collection and analysis": "",
        "Selection of studies": "All sources will be managed using Review Manager 5 software. The inclusion criteria will be based on the \u201cCriteria for considering the studies for this review\u201d detailed above. Decisions on inclusion/exclusion of studies will be made independently by two reviewers (HH and CH) using piloted criteria. Disagreements will be resolved with reference to a third experienced reviewer (SS and PP). The systematic review of diagnostic test accuracy of coagulation tests will target prospective cohort studies measuring accuracy relative to a reference standard and rigorous evaluation of time taken to obtain coagulation results.",
        "Data extraction and management": "We will extract the following data (where available) into a bespoke data extraction table.     Author, year of study, year of publication, journal reference.   Study design and timing of data collection (prospective/retrospective).   Study population and participant characteristics (age, sex, setting \u2013 e.g. hospital, region, country, other details given).    Trauma type and severity (Injury Severity Score \u2013 ISS).   Patient history.   Pre\u2010admission treatment, especially blood transfusion and/or additives.   Blood temperature and duration of bleed at point of testing.   Reference test used (PTr/INR) and any other measures taken (e.g. PT, APTT, Fibrinogen level, platelet count, fibrinogen degradation products).    Index test used (TEG/ROTEM) and version of device.   Any details about device reliability.   When tests were carried out in treatment phase (i.e. pre/post transfusion, timings).   Data from the 2 x 2 table will be extracted where presented, i.e. true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives.    QUADAS\u20102 items (see Table 2).     Where available, variability between operators and assay conditions will be recorded. Particular care is likely to be required on many of these items (index test and reference standard) because of lack of standardisation. The abstraction form will be piloted by two authors (HH and CH) using two primary diagnostic studies. A third author (NC) will resolve disagreements. The form will be accompanied by a briefing document explaining how it should be used. Data will be abstracted by one reviewer (HH) and checked by a second (CH), with a third author (NC) providing moderation as required.",
