    "title": "Transient elastography for diagnosis of stages of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis in people with alcoholic liver disease",
    "abstract": "Background The presence and progression of hepatic (liver) fibrosis into cirrhosis is a prognostic variable having impact on survival in people with alcoholic liver disease. Liver biopsy, although an invasive method, is the recommended 'reference standard' for diagnosis and staging of hepatic fibrosis in people with liver diseases. Transient elastography is a non\u2010invasive method for assessing and staging hepatic fibrosis.    Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of transient elastography for diagnosis and staging hepatic fibrosis in people with alcoholic liver disease when compared with liver biopsy. To identify the optimal cut\u2010off values for differentiating the five stages of hepatic fibrosis.    Search methods The Cochrane Hepato\u2010Biliary Group Controlled and Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies Registers, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), and the Science Citation Index Expanded (last search August 2014).    Selection criteria Diagnostic cohort and diagnostic case\u2010control study designs that assessed hepatic fibrosis in participants with alcoholic liver disease with transient elastography and liver biopsy, irrespective of language or publication status. The study participants could be of any sex and ethnic origin, above 16 years old, hospitalised or managed as outpatients. We excluded participants with viral hepatitis, autoimmunity, metabolic diseases, and toxins.    Data collection and analysis We followed the guidelines in the draft Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy.    Main results Five retrospective and nine prospective cohort studies with 834 participants provided data for the review analyses. Authors of seven of those studies sent us individual participant data. The risk of bias in the included studies was high in all but three studies. We could identify no serious concerns regarding the applicability of the studies in answering the main study question of our review, namely to use transient elastography to diagnose hepatic fibrosis. We could not identify the optimal cut\u2010off values for the fibrosis stages. The definition of the diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease was not provided in one study and was not clearly defined in two studies, but it was clear in the remaining 11 studies. The study authors used different liver stiffness cut\u2010off values of transient elastography for the hepatic fibrosis stages.  There was only one study (103 participants) with data on hepatic fibrosis stage F1 or worse, with a cut\u2010off of 5.9 kPa, and reporting sensitivity of 0.83 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 0.90) and specificity of 0.88 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.00). The summary sensitivity and specificity of transient elastography for F2 or worse (seven studies with 338 participants and with cut\u2010offs around 7.5 kPa (range 7.00 to 7.8 kPa)) were 0.94 and 0.89 with LR+ 8.2 and LR\u2010 0.07, which suggests that transient elastography could be useful to rule out the presence of significant hepatic fibrosis, thus avoiding liver biopsy.  Due to the wide range of cut\u2010off values (from 8.0 to 17.0 kPa) found in the 10 studies with 760 participants with hepatic fibrosis F3 or worse, we fitted a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model and estimated a summary ROC (SROC) curve. The sensitivity of the 10 studies varied from 72% to 100% and the specificity from 59% to 89%. We performed an additional analysis by including the studies with a cut\u2010off value of around and equal to 9.5 kPa (range 8.0 to 11.0 kPa). The summary sensitivity and specificity of transient elastography (eight studies with 564 participants) were 0.92 and 0.70 with LR+ 3.1 and LR\u2010 0.11, which suggests that transient elastography could also be useful to rule out the presence of severe hepatic fibrosis (F3 or worse), avoiding liver biopsy. We carried out a sensitivity analysis by considering only the studies with a cut\u2010off value equal to 9.5 kPa and the result did not differ.  We performed an HSROC analysis and reported an SROC curve for hepatic fibrosis stage F4 (cirrhosis). The HSROC analysis suggested that when the cut\u2010off value changes, there is a wide variation in specificity and a more limited variation in sensitivity. We performed an additional analysis with the studies with the most commonly used cut\u2010off value of 12.5 kPa. The summary sensitivity and specificity of transient elastography (seven studies with 330 participants) were 0.95 and 0.71 with LR+ 3.3 and LR\u2010 0.07, which again suggests that transient elastography could be useful to rule out the presence of cirrhosis, avoiding liver biopsy.    Authors' conclusions We identified a small number of studies with a few participants and were unable to include several studies, which raises the risk of outcome reporting bias. With these caveats in mind, transient elastography may be used as a diagnostic method to rule out liver cirrhosis (F4) in people with alcoholic liver disease when the pre\u2010test probability is about 51% (range 15% to 79%). Transient elastography may also help in ruling out severe fibrosis (F3 or worse). Liver biopsy investigation remains an option if the certainty to rule in or rule out the stage of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis remains insufficient after a clinical follow\u2010up or any other non\u2010invasive test considered useful by the clinician.  The proposed cut\u2010off values for the different stages of hepatic fibrosis may be used in clinical practice, but caution is needed, as those values reported in this review are only the most common cut\u2010off values used by the study authors. The best cut\u2010off values for hepatic fibrosis in people with alcoholic liver disease could not be established yet.  In order to diagnose correctly the stage of hepatic fibrosis in people with alcoholic liver disease using transient elastography assessment, the studies should consider a single aetiology. Hepatic fibrosis should be diagnosed with both transient elastography and liver biopsy and in this sequence, and transient elastography cut\u2010off values should be pre\u2010specified and validated. The time interval between the two investigations should not exceed three months, which is the interval mainly valid for people without cirrhosis, and assessment of results should be properly blinded. Only studies with low risk of bias, fulfilling the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy may answer the review question.",

        "Types of studies": "We sought to include diagnostic cohort studies and diagnostic case\u2010control studies that had assessed hepatic fibrosis in participants with alcoholic liver disease through transient elastography and liver biopsy, irrespective of language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively. We considered studies for inclusion also if they had included participants with different aetiologies of liver disease.",
        "Participants": "The studies had to include participants of any sex and ethnic origin, above 16 years old, and diagnosed with alcoholic liver disease. The participants could have been hospitalised or managed as outpatients. The diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease in the study participants had to be established based on registered history of excessive intake of alcohol of sufficient duration and quantity together with clinical evidence of liver disease expressed with physical signs at examination and followed by laboratory evidence of liver disease. To ascertain the diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease and study the presence or absence of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis, the studies had to perform both transient elastography and liver biopsy (Bouchier 1992). For this review, we did not consider for inclusion data on participants diagnosed with alcoholic liver disease and having a concomitant liver disease such as non\u2010alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic hepatitis C virus infection, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, autoimmune liver disease, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We extracted data on study participants with alcoholic liver disease alone whenever such data were available in the study report or whenever we could obtain the data required for the review through personal communication with study authors. In the latter case, we disregarded some of the data presented in the publication and used the data provided by the study authors through personal communication.",
        "Index tests": "Transient elastography, a non\u2010invasive test measuring liver stiffness in kiloPascals (kPa). Following the recommended technical parameters for transient elastography and to ensure the validity of the transient elastography result for every participant in the single studies, participants should have undergone at least 10 validated stiffness measurements at the same measurement point. The measurements should have had an interquartile range of 30% or less, and the ratio of the number of successful measurements to the total number of acquisitions should have been 60% or less (Echosens 2009). We only considered data from people who provided the full set of the described data. Transient elastography is not recommended for use in pregnant women, people with pacemakers, and people with ascites. Factors that may influence the success of transient elastography investigation are experience of the operator and body mass index of the person. Liver stiffness measurement can produce biased results depending on the grade of necro\u2010inflammation and grade of steatosis (Myers 2010).",
        "Target conditions": "The presence of hepatic fibrosis in people with alcoholic liver disease. Based on the METAVIR histopathological score for interpreting liver biopsy, there are five stages of hepatic fibrosis (Table 1). F0: no fibrosis.   F1: mild fibrosis.   F2: significant fibrosis.   F3: severe fibrosis.   F4: cirrhosis. F0: no fibrosis. F1: mild fibrosis. F2: significant fibrosis. F3: severe fibrosis. F4: cirrhosis. We dichotomised the hepatic fibrosis estimated by the METAVIR score as follows: people with METAVIR score of F1 or worse were considered 'diseased' and people with METAVIR score of F0 are considered 'non\u2010diseased';    people with METAVIR score of F2 or worse were considered 'diseased' and people with METAVIR score of F0 plus F1 are considered 'non\u2010diseased';    people with METAVIR score of F3 or worse were considered 'diseased' and people with METAVIR score of F0 plus F1 plus F2 are considered 'non\u2010diseased';    people with METAVIR score of F4 were considered 'diseased' and people with METAVIR score of F0 plus F1 plus F2 plus F3 are considered 'non\u2010diseased'. people with METAVIR score of F1 or worse were considered 'diseased' and people with METAVIR score of F0 are considered 'non\u2010diseased'; people with METAVIR score of F2 or worse were considered 'diseased' and people with METAVIR score of F0 plus F1 are considered 'non\u2010diseased'; people with METAVIR score of F3 or worse were considered 'diseased' and people with METAVIR score of F0 plus F1 plus F2 are considered 'non\u2010diseased'; people with METAVIR score of F4 were considered 'diseased' and people with METAVIR score of F0 plus F1 plus F2 plus F3 are considered 'non\u2010diseased'.",
        "Reference standards": "Liver biopsy is the reference standard that is obtained by percutaneous needle techniques, transjugular method, ultrasound\u2010guided fine\u2010needle, or surgical specimens (Kuntz 2008; Ivashkin 2011b). Liver biopsy is the only existing reference standard so far for diagnosing hepatic fibrosis stages in people with alcoholic liver disease. Specimens of liver tissue with a mean length of at least 15 mm and at least seven portal tracts are among the factors that can provide reliable morphological staging of hepatic fibrosis and grading of inflammation (Rockey 2009). If liver biopsy samples were reported with any of the semi\u2010quantitative scores, that is, METAVIR (Franciscus 2007), Knodell (Franciscus 2007), Ishak (Franciscus 2007), Kleiner (Kleiner 2005), Scheuer (Regev 2002), Brunt (Brunt 1999), or Batts\u2010Ludwig (Haque 2010), we used a conversion grid for hepatic fibrosis staging adapted after Goodman 2007 (Table 1) to unify results on the grade of hepatic fibrosis on liver biopsy. For grading alcoholic steatosis, we used the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network scoring system (Kleiner 2005) (Table 2). Evaluation of parenchymal involvement by steatosis Steatosis grade < 5% 0 5% to 33% 1 34% to 66% 2 > 66% 3"

To ascertain the diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease and study the presence or absence of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis or both in each of the study participants, both transient elastography and liver biopsy should have been performed.    Describe the index test and how it was conducted and interpreted:\u00a0  Transient elastography for grading hepatic fibrosis conducted either before or after liver biopsy.  The recommended technical parameters of transient elastography investigation are at least 10 validated stiffness measurements at the same measurement point, an interquartile range of no more than 30%, and the ratio of the number of successful measurements to the total investigational number of acquisitions should be no less than 60% (www.echosens.com/pdf/FS402_WEB.pdf).    Describe the reference standard and how it was conducted and interpreted:\u00a0  Liver biopsy is useful in establishing the grade of hepatic fibrosis in people with alcoholic liver disease.  The morphological interpretation of the liver biopsy samples is reported with semi\u2010quantitative scores, such as METAVIR, Knodell, Ishak, Kleiner, Scheuer, or Brunt (see Table 1).
