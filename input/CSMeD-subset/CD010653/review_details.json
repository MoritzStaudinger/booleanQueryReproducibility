    "title": "First rank symptoms for schizophrenia",
    "abstract": "Background Early and accurate diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia may have long\u2010term advantages for the patient; the longer psychosis goes untreated the more severe the repercussions for relapse and recovery. If the correct diagnosis is not schizophrenia, but another psychotic disorder with some symptoms similar to schizophrenia, appropriate treatment might be delayed, with possible severe repercussions for the person involved and their family. There is widespread uncertainty about the diagnostic accuracy of First Rank Symptoms (FRS); we examined whether they are a useful diagnostic tool to differentiate schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders.    Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of one or multiple FRS for diagnosing schizophrenia, verified by clinical history and examination by a qualified professional (e.g. psychiatrists, nurses, social workers), with or without the use of operational criteria and checklists, in people thought to have non\u2010organic psychotic symptoms.    Search methods We conducted searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycInfo using OvidSP in April, June, July 2011 and December 2012. We also searched MEDION in December 2013.    Selection criteria We selected studies that consecutively enrolled or randomly selected adults and adolescents with symptoms of psychosis, and assessed the diagnostic accuracy of FRS for schizophrenia compared to history and clinical examination performed by a qualified professional, which may or may not involve the use of symptom checklists or based on operational criteria such as ICD and DSM.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened all references for inclusion. Risk of bias in included studies were assessed using the QUADAS\u20102 instrument. We recorded the number of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) for constructing a 2 x 2 table for each study or derived 2 x 2 data from reported summary statistics such as sensitivity, specificity, and/or likelihood ratios.    Main results We included 21 studies with a total of 6253 participants (5515 were included in the analysis). Studies were conducted from 1974 to 2011, with 80% of the studies conducted in the 1970's, 1980's or 1990's. Most studies did not report study methods sufficiently and many had high applicability concerns. In 20 studies, FRS differentiated schizophrenia from all other diagnoses with a sensitivity of 57% (50.4% to 63.3%), and a specificity of 81.4% (74% to 87.1%) In seven studies, FRS differentiated schizophrenia from non\u2010psychotic mental health disorders with a sensitivity of 61.8% (51.7% to 71%) and a specificity of 94.1% (88% to 97.2%). In sixteen studies, FRS differentiated schizophrenia from other types of psychosis with a sensitivity of 58% (50.3% to 65.3%) and a specificity of 74.7% (65.2% to 82.3%).    Authors' conclusions The synthesis of old studies of limited quality in this review indicates that FRS correctly identifies people with schizophrenia 75% to 95% of the time. The use of FRS to diagnose schizophrenia in triage will incorrectly diagnose around five to 19 people in every 100 who have FRS as having schizophrenia and specialists will not agree with this diagnosis. These people will still merit specialist assessment and help due to the severity of disturbance in their behaviour and mental state. Again, with a sensitivity of FRS of 60%, reliance on FRS to diagnose schizophrenia in triage will not correctly diagnose around 40% of people that specialists will consider to have schizophrenia. Some of these people may experience a delay in getting appropriate treatment. Others, whom specialists will consider to have schizophrenia, could be prematurely discharged from care, if triage relies on the presence of FRS to diagnose schizophrenia. Empathetic, considerate use of FRS as a diagnostic aid \u2010 with known limitations \u2010 should avoid a good proportion of these errors.  We hope that newer tests \u2010 to be included in future Cochrane reviews \u2010 will show better results. However, symptoms of first rank can still be helpful where newer tests are not available \u2010 a situation which applies to the initial screening of most people with suspected schizophrenia. FRS remain a simple, quick and useful clinical indicator for an illness of enormous clinical variability.",

    "criteria": {
        "Types of studies": "We included both retrospective and prospective studies, which consecutively or randomly selected participants. We excluded case\u2010control studies that used healthy controls. Studies were included that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of First Rank Symptoms (one or multiple) for diagnosis of schizophrenia compared with a reference standard, irrespective of publication status and language.",
        "Participants": "We included adolescents and adults presenting with psychotic symptoms, which included symptoms such as, hallucinations, delusions, disordered thinking and speech, grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour, or negative symptoms (i.e. affective flattening, alogia, or volition). We did not exclude on the grounds of co\u2010morbidities. In addition, if a study reported all admissions to a psychiatric ward instead of only people admitted with psychosis, the study, including those participants with non\u2010psychotic symptoms, was not excluded. We did exclude if participants had organic source of psychosis, such as that triggered by an existent physical disease or alcohol and drug abuse. Particular attention was paid to history, current clinical state (acute, post\u2010acute or quiescent), stage of illness (prodromal, early, established, late), or if there were predominant clinical issues (negative or positive symptoms). In addition, setting and referral status of people in the study was noted. We recognise that people in psychiatric hospital have already experienced a considerable degree of prior testing compared with those in community settings. Also, for similar reasons, people referred to a specialist centre treating only those with schizophrenia may well be different to those in general care.",
        "Index tests": "Schneider First Rank Symptoms (Table 1). The presence of any one of these symptoms, or multiple symptoms, would be indicative of a diagnosis of schizophrenia. We consider this an acceptable variation in threshold as Kurt Schneider proposed that presence of any one of these symptoms was diagnostic of schizophrenia as long as the person was free of other organic causes such as substance misuse, epilepsy or tumours (Schneider 1959). The different value of one symptom over another is not the focus of this review.",
        "Target conditions": "All types of schizophrenia disorder regardless of descriptive subcategory (e.g. paranoid, disorganised, catatonic, undifferentiated and residual). Studies that reported results combined for diagnoses related to schizophrenia (e.g. schizoaffective and schizophreniform disorder) in which data could not be separated were included and we investigated potential heterogeneity.",
        "Reference standards": "The reference standard is history and clinical examination collected by a qualified professional (e.g., psychiatrists, nurses, social workers), which may or may not involve the use of operational criteria or checklists of symptoms such as: International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD\u20109 or ICD\u201010) (Table 2);    Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM\u2010III or DSM\u2010IV) (Table 3);    Feighner (Feighner 1972);    Research Diagnostic Criteria (Spitzer 1978);    Carpenter criteria (Carpenter 1973);    New Haven (Astrachan 1974);    Taylor Abrams (Taylor 1978);    Bleulerian (Bleuler 1950) and/or ego function (Bellak 1973). International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD\u20109 or ICD\u201010) (Table 2); Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM\u2010III or DSM\u2010IV) (Table 3); Feighner (Feighner 1972); Research Diagnostic Criteria (Spitzer 1978); Carpenter criteria (Carpenter 1973); New Haven (Astrachan 1974); Taylor Abrams (Taylor 1978); Bleulerian (Bleuler 1950) and/or ego function (Bellak 1973). The more modern of these criteria involve some degree of follow\u2010up. Ideally, in order to avoid incorporation bias the reference standard and the diagnostic test under consideration should be entirely independent of one another (Worster 2008). We were not be able to avoid incorporation bias with this review, as in most cases the reference standard incorporated FRS and hence the diagnostic accuracy may potentially be overestimated (Worster 2008). Also, in many cases using FRS also included taking a history and clinical examination, again contaminating the uniqueness of either approach. Differences between FRS and the reference standard lies in utilisation of: a longitudinal frame work in addition to the cross sectional assessment of specific symptoms of psychosis such as FRS (reflecting limbic system abnormalities); and    less specific symptoms of psychosis such as the consequences of having acute psychotic symptoms and the deleterious effects of psychosis. a longitudinal frame work in addition to the cross sectional assessment of specific symptoms of psychosis such as FRS (reflecting limbic system abnormalities); and less specific symptoms of psychosis such as the consequences of having acute psychotic symptoms and the deleterious effects of psychosis. Heterogeneity due to whether FRSs or any operational criteria were used as part of the reference standard was investigated."
