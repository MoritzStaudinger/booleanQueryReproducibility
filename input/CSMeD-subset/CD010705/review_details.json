    "abstract": "Background Genotype\u00ae MTBDRsl (MTBDRsl) is a rapid DNA\u2010based test for detecting specific mutations associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and second\u2010line injectable drugs (SLIDs) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. MTBDRsl version 2.0 (released in 2015) identifies the mutations detected by version 1.0, as well as additional mutations. The test may be performed on a culture isolate or a patient specimen, which eliminates delays associated with culture. Version 1.0 requires a smear\u2010positive specimen, while version 2.0 may use a smear\u2010positive or \u2010negative specimen. We performed this updated review as part of a World Health Organization process to develop updated guidelines for using MTBDRsl.    Objectives To assess and compare the diagnostic accuracy of MTBDRsl for: 1. fluoroquinolone resistance, 2. SLID resistance, and 3. extensively drug\u2010resistant tuberculosis, indirectly on a M. tuberculosis isolate grown from culture or directly on a patient specimen. Participants were people with rifampicin\u2010resistant or multidrug\u2010resistant tuberculosis. The role of MTBDRsl would be as the initial test, replacing culture\u2010based drug susceptibility testing (DST), for detecting second\u2010line drug resistance.    Search methods We searched the following databases without language restrictions up to 21 September 2015: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; MEDLINE; Embase OVID; Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index\u2010Science, and BIOSIS Previews (all three from Web of Science); LILACS; and SCOPUS; registers for ongoing trials; and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I. We reviewed references from included studies and contacted specialists in the field.    Selection criteria We included cross\u2010sectional and case\u2010control studies that determined MTBDRsl accuracy against a defined reference standard (culture\u2010based DST, genetic sequencing, or both).    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS\u20102) tool. We synthesized data for versions 1.0 and 2.0 separately. We estimated MTBDRsl sensitivity and specificity for fluoroquinolone resistance, SLID resistance, and extensively drug\u2010resistant tuberculosis when the test was performed indirectly or directly (smear\u2010positive specimen for version 1.0, smear\u2010positive or \u2010negative specimen for version 2.0). We explored the influence on accuracy estimates of individual drugs within a drug class and of different reference standards. We performed most analyses using a bivariate random\u2010effects model with culture\u2010based DST as reference standard.    Main results We included 27 studies. Twenty\u2010six studies evaluated version 1.0, and one study version 2.0. Of 26 studies stating specimen country origin, 15 studies (58%) evaluated patients from low\u2010 or middle\u2010income countries. Overall, we considered the studies to be of high methodological quality. However, only three studies (11%) had low risk of bias for the reference standard; these studies used World Health Organization (WHO)\u2010recommended critical concentrations for all drugs in the culture\u2010based DST reference standard.  MTBDRsl version 1.0  Fluoroquinolone resistance: indirect testing, MTBDRsl pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval (CI)) were 85.6% (79.2% to 90.4%) and 98.5% (95.7% to 99.5%), (19 studies, 2223 participants); direct testing (smear\u2010positive specimen), pooled sensitivity and specificity were 86.2% (74.6% to 93.0%) and 98.6% (96.9% to 99.4%), (nine studies, 1771 participants, moderate quality evidence).  SLID resistance: indirect testing, MTBDRsl pooled sensitivity and specificity were 76.5% (63.3% to 86.0%) and 99.1% (97.3% to 99.7%), (16 studies, 1921 participants); direct testing (smear\u2010positive specimen), pooled sensitivity and specificity were 87.0% (38.1% to 98.6%) and 99.5% (93.6% to 100.0%), (eight studies, 1639 participants, low quality evidence).  Extensively drug\u2010resistant tuberculosis: indirect testing, MTBDRsl pooled sensitivity and specificity were 70.9% (42.9% to 88.8%) and 98.8% (96.1% to 99.6%), (eight studies, 880 participants); direct testing (smear\u2010positive specimen), pooled sensitivity and specificity were 69.4% (38.8% to 89.0%) and 99.4% (95.0% to 99.3%), (six studies, 1420 participants, low quality evidence).  Similar to the original Cochrane review, we found no evidence of a significant difference in MTBDRsl version 1.0 accuracy between indirect and direct testing for fluoroquinolone resistance, SLID resistance, and extensively drug\u2010resistant tuberculosis.  MTBDRsl version 2.0  Fluoroquinolone resistance: direct testing, MTBDRsl sensitivity and specificity were 97% (83% to 100%) and 98% (93% to 100%), smear\u2010positive specimen; 80% (28% to 99%) and 100% (40% to 100%), smear\u2010negative specimen.  SLID resistance: direct testing, MTBDRsl sensitivity and specificity were 89% (72% to 98%) and 90% (84% to 95%), smear\u2010positive specimen; 80% (28% to 99%) and 100% (40% to 100%), smear\u2010negative specimen.  Extensively drug\u2010resistant tuberculosis: direct testing, MTBDRsl sensitivity and specificity were 79% (49% to 95%) and 97% (93% to 99%), smear\u2010positive specimen; 50% (1% to 99%) and 100% (59% to 100%), smear\u2010negative specimen.  We had insufficient data to estimate summary sensitivity and specificity of version 2.0 (smear\u2010positive and \u2010negative specimens) or to compare accuracy of the two versions.  A limitation was that most included studies did not consistently use the World Health Organization (WHO)\u2010recommended concentrations for drugs in the culture\u2010based DST reference standard.    Authors' conclusions In people with rifampicin\u2010resistant or multidrug\u2010resistant tuberculosis, MTBDRsl performed on a culture isolate or smear\u2010positive specimen may be useful in detecting second\u2010line drug resistance. MTBDRsl (smear\u2010positive specimen) correctly classified around six in seven people as having fluoroquinolone or SLID resistance, although the sensitivity estimates for SLID resistance varied. The test rarely gave a positive result for people without drug resistance. However, when second\u2010line drug resistance is not detected (MTBDRsl result is negative), conventional DST can still be used to evaluate patients for resistance to the fluoroquinolones or SLIDs.  We recommend that future work evaluate MTBDRsl version 2.0, in particular on smear\u2010negative specimens and in different settings to account for different resistance\u2010causing mutations that may vary by strain. Researchers should also consider incorporating WHO\u2010recommended critical concentrations into their culture\u2010based reference standards.",

        "Reference standards": "We included studies that used one or more of the following reference standards. Culture\u2010based drug susceptibility testing (DST): solid culture or a liquid culture.   Sequencing of the gyrA or rrs genes (MTBDRsl version 1.0) or additionally the gyrB and eis promoter regions (MTBDRsl version 2.0).    A composite reference standard with two components: culture\u2010based DST and sequencing of the same samples. If a specimen was resistant according to culture\u2010based DST or had a mutation, we classified the specimen as having the target condition. If both culture\u2010based DST and sequencing indicated susceptibility, we classified the specimen as not having the target condition.    Two reference standards used sequentially: culture\u2010based DST followed by selective testing by sequencing of samples with discrepant results. Discrepant results may be either index test positive/culture\u2010based DST negative or index test negative/culture\u2010based DST positive. Culture\u2010based drug susceptibility testing (DST): solid culture or a liquid culture.

Discrepant results may be either index test positive/culture\u2010based DST negative or index test negative/culture\u2010based DST positive. There are strengths and limitations to each of the reference standards. Culture\u2010based DST is the accepted reference standard, but it is considered to be imperfect and is dependent on the drug concentration threshold used to define resistance. Sequencing is considered to be more accurate than culture\u2010based DST; however, this is only if it targets all known resistance\u2010determining regions, which are not fully known for the FQs and the SLIDs. Therefore, targeted sequencing may miss mutations that cause drug resistance. We carried out separate analyses for the different reference standards, which we have described below. In our primary analysis we used culture\u2010based DST as the reference standard. We expected all or nearly all included studies to report results using this reference standard."

        "Appendix 1. Glossary of terms": "Amplification  Amplification is replication of a DNA fragment to generate copies. Both the original and the newly synthesized copies can be described as the amplicons.  Codon  A codon is a sequence of three DNA or RNA bases that corresponds to a specific amino acid or a signal to start or stop transcription or translation. The DNA in coding regions of the genome is read in groups of three bases (A, G, C, T).  Conjugate and amplification bands (controls)  The conjugate band is a control to make sure that the DNA probes immobilized on the MTBDRsl strip test can bind M. tuberculosis DNA and that this is detectable, to ensure that the test is working properly. If this is not present, we will be unsure if the results of the test are due to something going wrong with the test that prevents binding of the bands, or a real phenomenon. Hence, an MTBDRsl test is indeterminate if the conjugate band is missing. Similarly, the amplification band is a control to make sure that the amplification of M. tuberculosis DNA (which is done in order to bring target DNA sequences to a detectable level) was successful. If this band is absent, and we do not see any probes corresponding to mutations appearing, we cannot discount a failure to amplify DNA rather than the presence of a susceptible strain.  Culture isolates  Culture isolates refers to M. tuberculosis cells from a clinical specimen that have been grown. For TB diagnosis, a volume of the clinical specimen is processed and incubated under conditions that promote M. tuberculosis growth. The cells that are grown are referred to a culture isolate.  Drug susceptibility testing  Drug susceptibility tests determine whether M. tuberculosis cells are sensitive or resistant to antibiotics. Testing may be undertaken using phenotypic or genotypic analyses. Phenotypic testing requires growth of TB in the presence of drugs that will inhibit the growth of a sensitive organism or have no impact on growth of a resistant organism. Genotypic testing involves detecting predetermined mutations in DNA that are known to make the organism resistant to a drug. When mutations causing drug resistance are not known, genotypic DST is not useful. Genotype\u00ae MTBDRsl is a genotypic test.  DNA sequencing  DNA sequencing is a process to determine the nucleotide (A, G, C, T) sequence of fragments of DNA. By comparison of DNA sequences from distinct TB isolates, variations known as mutations can be identified. Some mutations in M. tuberculosis are known to cause drug resistance.  Hybridization  Hybridization is the process of allowing two nucleotide fragments to bind together if they share DNA sequences that are complementary. Hybridisation reactions can be designed such that when one strand binds to another, the reaction may produce a detectable colour change, which is what occurs in MTBDRsl.  Locus  A locus is the position of a genetic feature in the DNA sequence, like a genetic street address. Loci are standardized between genomes by reference to a common reference genome, such as H37Rv for M. tuberculosis.  Promoter region  A promoter region is a sequence of DNA where the transcriptional machinery binds before transcribing the DNA into RNA that may then be translated into an amino acid sequence.  Resistance\u2010determining region  A region of the M. tuberculosis genome where mutations commonly cause resistance to a specific drug.  We have adapted these definitions from NIH 2015.",

        "Appendix 3. QUADAS\u20102 rules and interpretation": "Domain 1: Patient selection  Risk of bias: could the selection of patients have introduced bias?  Signaling question 1: was a consecutive or random sample of patients enrolled? We scored 'yes' if the study enrolled a consecutive or random sample of eligible patients; 'no' if the study selected patients by convenience; and 'unclear' if the study did not report the manner of patient selection or was not clearly reported.    Signaling question 2: was a case\u2010control design avoided? We scored 'yes' if the study enrolled only TB patients with suspected resistance to second\u2010line drugs, including patients with confirmed multidrug\u2010resistant tuberculosis (MDR\u2010TB); 'no' if the study enrolled TB patients with confirmed resistance to second\u2010line drugs; and 'unclear' for all other scenarios or if it was not clearly reported.    Signaling question 3: did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions? An inappropriate exclusion might occur if, after the laboratory technician runs the index and reference tests, he or she does not record the test results in the study. This might occur if there were resource constraints as one might find in practice, but we did not expect this to occur in the research studies included in this review. We scored 'yes' for all studies.    Applicability: are there concerns that the included patients and setting do not match the review question?  We judged 'low' concern if the selected specimens matched the review question, which reflects the way the test will be used in practice. We judged 'high' concern if the selected specimens or isolates did not represent those for whom the test will be used in practice, such as in individuals who are not suspected of having drug\u2010resistant TB. We judged 'unclear' concern if we could not tell.      Domain 2: Index test  Risk of bias: could the conduct or interpretation of the index test have introduced bias?   Signaling question 1: were the index test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard?  We scored this question 'yes' if the reader of the assay was blinded to results of reference tests. We scored 'no' if the reader of the assay was not blinded to the results of reference tests. If the specimens were from a biobank (repository that stores biological specimens) comprised of specimens with known second\u2010line drug resistance and the identity of these specimens was known to the assay reader, we also answered 'no'. We scored 'unclear' if it was not stated in the paper or if the study authors failed to answer this question.    Signaling question 2: if a threshold was used, was it prespecified? A threshold is prespecified in all versions of MTBDRsl. We answered this question 'yes' for all studies.    Applicability: are there concerns that the index test, its conduct, or its interpretation differ from the review question?  Variations in test technology, execution, or interpretation may affect estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of a test. We judged the study to be of 'low concern' for applicability if the test was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. We judged the study to be of 'low concern' for applicability if the test was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. We judged the study to be of 'high concern' when the test was applied differently than recommended by the manufacturer, for example when the test was applied to pooled sputa, and we judged the study to be of 'unclear concern' when we could not tell. When available, we selected the high level WHO\u2010recommended concentration for moxifloxacin because we felt this concentration was clinically meaningful.      Domain 3: Reference standard  Risk of bias: could the reference standard, its conduct or its interpretation have introduced bias?   Signaling question 1: is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition?  Culture\u2010based DST is not 100% accurate for detection of drug resistance, especially resistance to second\u2010line drugs. However, it is the test currently endorsed by WHO when performed using WHO\u2010recommended critical drug concentrations (defined below WHO 2012). Therefore, for culture\u2010based DST, we answered 'yes' if study authors used WHO critical concentrations for every test evaluation, 'no' if study authors did not use critical concentrations (or if for the culture method used, WHO\u2010recommended critical concentrations did not exist) in any of their test evaluations, and 'unclear' if study authors used critical concentrations in only some evaluations and not others or the authors did not specify the critical concentrations used. We selected the WHO\u2010recommended high level concentration for moxifloxacin because we felt this concentration was clinically meaningful.  We used the currently\u2010recommended WHO critical concentrations as a benchmark for judging risk of bias (WHO 2012). For M. tuberculosis, the antimicrobial susceptibility testing 'critical concentration' is defined as \u201cfor each drug, the lowest concentration that inhibits 95% (90% for pyrazinamide) of wild\u2010type strains of M. tuberculosis that have not been exposed to the drug, but that simultaneously does not inhibit strains of M. tuberculosis that are considered resistant that are isolated from patients who are not responding to therapy\u201d (CSLI 2011). However, there is a lack of consensus about this definition (\u00c4ngeby 2012).  Genetic sequencing (gene sequencing of loci known to be associated with drug resistance) is considered by researchers in this field to be the best reference standard for testing for the presence of drug resistance. Although sequencing may not be performed for all regions of the TB genome associated with resistance, we consider this to be a concern about the setting in which the test is applied, rather than a concern about risk of bias.    Signaling question 2: were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index test?  We scored 'yes' if the reference test provided an automated result (for example,\u00a0MGIT 960 DST), blinding was explicitly stated, or it was clear that the reference test was performed at a separate laboratory, or performed by different people, or both. We scored 'no' if the study stated that the reference standard result was interpreted with knowledge of the MTBDRsl assay result.\u00a0We scored 'unclear' if it was not stated in the paper or if the authors failed to answer this question.    Applicability: are there concerns that the target condition as defined by the reference standard does not match the question?  We judged applicability to be of 'low concern' for all studies because the method used (phenotypic testing with and without drugs) was appropriate.      Domain 4: Flow and timing  Risk of bias: could the patient flow have introduced bias?  Signaling question 1: was there an appropriate interval between the index test and reference standard?  We expected the reference standard test to be undertaken at the same time as the index test (i.e. each performed on a paired sample for most studies). However, we expected some studies to include specimens from patients who had received a reference test on an earlier sample. The sample applies to some culture isolates, whose drug susceptibility profile might have been confirmed prior to the index test being available. We answered 'yes' if the tests were paired or were separated by a few days. We answered 'no' if reference and index tests were not done on paired samples and were separated by several months. As patients suspected of second\u2010line drug resistance are often on some form of anti\u2010TB therapy, it is possible that variation in the microbial population of specimens collected at different time points may occur. We scored 'unclear\u2019 if it was not stated in the paper or if the authors failed to answer this question.    Signaling question 2: did all patients receive the same reference standard? Our reference standard for the primary objectives was culture\u2010based DST and we anticipated this reference standard to be used in all studies. We answered 'yes' if culture\u2010based DST was applied to all patients or a random sample of patients, 'no' if the reference standard was only applied to a selective group of patients, and 'unclear' if it was not stated in the paper or if the authors failed to answer this question.    Signaling question 3: were all patients included in the analysis? We determined the answer to this question by comparing the number of participants enrolled with the number of patients included in the 2 x 2 tables. We noted if the study authors reported the number of indeterminate assay results. We scored 'yes' if the number of participants enrolled was clearly stated and corresponded to the number presented in the analysis or if exclusions were adequately described. We scored 'no' if there were participants missing or excluded from the analysis and there was no explanation given. We scored 'unclear' if not enough information was given to assess whether participants were excluded from the analysis.",

        "Signaling question 2: was a case\u2010control design avoided?": "We scored 'yes' if the study enrolled only TB patients with suspected resistance to second\u2010line drugs, including patients with confirmed multidrug\u2010resistant tuberculosis (MDR\u2010TB); 'no' if the study enrolled TB patients with confirmed resistance to second\u2010line drugs; and 'unclear' for all other scenarios or if it was not clearly reported.",
        "Signaling question 3: did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions?": "An inappropriate exclusion might occur if, after the laboratory technician runs the index and reference tests, he or she does not record the test results in the study. This might occur if there were resource constraints as one might find in practice, but we did not expect this to occur in the research studies included in this review. We scored 'yes' for all studies.",
        "Applicability: are there concerns that the included patients and setting do not match the review question?": "We judged 'low' concern if the selected specimens matched the review question, which reflects the way the test will be used in practice. We judged 'high' concern if the selected specimens or isolates did not represent those for whom the test will be used in practice, such as in individuals who are not suspected of having drug\u2010resistant TB.

Signaling question 1: is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition?  Culture\u2010based DST is not 100% accurate for detection of drug resistance, especially resistance to second\u2010line drugs. However, it is the test currently endorsed by WHO when performed using WHO\u2010recommended critical drug concentrations (defined below WHO 2012). Therefore, for culture\u2010based DST, we answered 'yes' if study authors used WHO critical concentrations for every test evaluation, 'no' if study authors did not use critical concentrations (or if for the culture method used, WHO\u2010recommended critical concentrations did not exist) in any of their test evaluations, and 'unclear' if study authors used critical concentrations in only some evaluations and not others or the authors did not specify the critical concentrations used. We selected the WHO\u2010recommended high level concentration for moxifloxacin because we felt this concentration was clinically meaningful.  We used the currently\u2010recommended WHO critical concentrations as a benchmark for judging risk of bias (WHO 2012). For M. tuberculosis, the antimicrobial susceptibility testing 'critical concentration' is defined as \u201cfor each drug, the lowest concentration that inhibits 95% (90% for pyrazinamide) of wild\u2010type strains of M. tuberculosis that have not been exposed to the drug, but that simultaneously does not inhibit strains of M. tuberculosis that are considered resistant that are isolated from patients who are not responding to therapy\u201d (CSLI 2011). However, there is a lack of consensus about this definition (\u00c4ngeby 2012).  Genetic sequencing (gene sequencing of loci known to be associated with drug resistance) is considered by researchers in this field to be the best reference standard for testing for the presence of drug resistance. Although sequencing may not be performed for all regions of the TB genome associated with resistance, we consider this to be a concern about the setting in which the test is applied, rather than a concern about risk of bias.    Signaling question 2: were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index test?  We scored 'yes' if the reference test provided an automated result (for example,\u00a0MGIT 960 DST), blinding was explicitly stated, or it was clear that the reference test was performed at a separate laboratory, or performed by different people, or both.
