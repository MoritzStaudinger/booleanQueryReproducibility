    "title": "D\u2010dimer test for excluding the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism",
    "abstract": "Background Pulmonary embolism (PE) can occur when a thrombus (blood clot) travels through the veins and lodges in the arteries of the lungs, producing an obstruction. People who are thought to be at risk include those with cancer, people who have had a recent surgical procedure or have experienced long periods of immobilisation and women who are pregnant. The clinical presentation can vary, but unexplained respiratory symptoms such as difficulty breathing, chest pain and an increased respiratory rate are common.  D\u2010dimers are fragments of protein released into the circulation when a blood clot breaks down as a result of normal body processes or with use of prescribed fibrinolytic medication. The D\u2010dimer test is a laboratory assay currently used to rule out the presence of high D\u2010dimer plasma levels and, by association, venous thromboembolism (VTE). D\u2010dimer tests are rapid, simple and inexpensive and can prevent the high costs associated with expensive diagnostic tests.    Objectives To investigate the ability of the D\u2010dimer test to rule out a diagnosis of acute PE in patients treated in hospital outpatient and accident and emergency (A&E) settings who have had a pre\u2010test probability (PTP) of PE determined according to a clinical prediction rule (CPR), by estimating the accuracy of the test according to estimates of sensitivity and specificity. The review focuses on those patients who are not already established on anticoagulation at the time of study recruitment.    Search methods We searched 13 databases from conception until December 2013. We cross\u2010checked the reference lists of relevant studies.    Selection criteria Two review authors independently applied exclusion criteria to full papers and resolved disagreements by discussion.  We included cross\u2010sectional studies of D\u2010dimer in which ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy, computerised tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), selective pulmonary angiography and magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography (MRPA) were used as the reference standard.  \u2022 Participants: Adults who were managed in hospital outpatient and A&E settings and were suspected of acute PE were eligible for inclusion in the review if they had received a pre\u2010test probability score based on a CPR.  \u2022 Index tests: quantitative, semi quantitative and qualitative D\u2010dimer tests. \u2022 Target condition: acute symptomatic PE. \u2022 Reference standards: We included studies that used pulmonary angiography, V/Q scintigraphy, CTPA and MRPA as reference standard tests.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies\u20102 (QUADAS\u20102). We resolved disagreements by discussion. Review authors extracted patient\u2010level data when available to populate 2 \u00d7 2 contingency tables (true\u2010positives (TPs), true\u2010negatives (TNs), false\u2010positives (FPs) and false\u2010negatives (FNs)).    Main results We included four studies in the review (n = 1585 patients). None of the studies were at high risk of bias in any of the QUADAS\u20102 domains, but some uncertainty surrounded the validity of studies in some domains for which the risk of bias was uncertain. D\u2010dimer assays demonstrated high sensitivity in all four studies, but with high levels of false\u2010positive results, especially among those over the age of 65 years. Estimates of sensitivity ranged from 80% to 100%, and estimates of specificity from 23% to 63%.    Authors' conclusions A negative D\u2010dimer test is valuable in ruling out PE in patients who present to the A&E setting with a low PTP. Evidence from one study suggests that this test may have less utility in older populations, but no empirical evidence was available to support an increase in the diagnostic threshold of interpretation of D\u2010dimer results for those over the age of 65 years.",

        "Types of studies": "We included cross\u2010sectional studies evaluating the diagnostic test accuracy of D\u2010dimer and diagnostic cohort studies, including both prospective and retrospective designs. We excluded diagnostic case\u2010control studies (two\u2010gate design). Case\u2010control designs are known to overestimate the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test in clinical practice (Rutjes 2005). In this review, we considered studies that use a CPR with D\u2010dimer testing to rule out PE in patients treated in outpatient and A&E departments. Specifically, we included studies that recruited symptomatic outpatients with low\u2010, intermediate\u2010 or high\u2010risk CPR scores.",
        "Participants": "Adults treated in hospital outpatient and A&E settings and suspected of acute PE as a result of clinical features such as breathlessness, chest pain, coughing up blood, increased respiratory rate, tachycardia, low blood pressure and fainting, in whom a PTP of PE has been assessed by a CPR for PE (examples of which can be found above under the heading Index test(s)) were eligible for inclusion in the review. When the data were available, we intended to group patients according to whether or not they received anticoagulant treatment, the specific CPR and the D\u2010dimer assay, as these are not standardised (Schreiber 2002). Patients with indeterminate or conflicting test results may undergo repeat imaging; the most commonly used imaging test for this is CTPA or V/Q scanning, but eligibility criteria of the review specify inclusion only of studies investigating the diagnostic accuracy of the initial D\u2010dimer test. We excluded studies that included pregnant women, people with cancer and mixed groups of patients, when results were not reported separately for those who are pregnant or with and without cancer.",
