    "title": "Imaging for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in pregnancy",
    "abstract": "Background Pulmonary embolism is a leading cause of pregnancy\u2010related death. An accurate diagnosis in pregnant patients is crucial to prevent untreated pulmonary embolism as well as unnecessary anticoagulant treatment and future preventive measures. Applied imaging techniques might perform differently in these younger patients with less comorbidity and altered physiology, who largely have been excluded from diagnostic studies.    Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), lung scintigraphy and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism during pregnancy.    Search methods We searched MEDLINE and Embase until July 2015. We used included studies as seeds in citations searches and in 'find similar' functions and searched reference lists. We approached experts in the field to help us identify non\u2010indexed studies.    Selection criteria We included consecutive series of pregnant patients suspected of pulmonary embolism who had undergone one of the index tests (computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography, lung scintigraphy or MRA) and clinical follow\u2010up or pulmonary angiography as a reference test.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors performed data extraction and quality assessment. We contacted investigators of potentially eligible studies to obtain missing information. In the primary analysis, we regarded inconclusive index test results as a negative reference test, and treatment for pulmonary embolism after an inconclusive index test as a positive reference test.    Main results We included 11 studies (four CTPA, five lung scintigraphy, two both) with a total of 695 CTPA and 665 lung scintigraphy results. Lung scintigraphy was applied by different techniques. No MRA studies matched our inclusion criteria.  Overall, risk of bias and concerns regarding applicability were high in all studies as judged in light of the review research question, as was heterogeneity in study methods. We did not undertake meta\u2010analysis. All studies used clinical follow\u2010up as a reference standard, none in a manner that enabled reliable identification of false positives. Sensitivity and negative predictive value were therefore the only valid test accuracy measures.  The median negative predictive value for CTPA was 100% (range 96% to 100%). Median sensitivity was 83% (range 0% to 100%).  The median negative predictive value for lung scintigraphy was 100% (range 99% to 100%). Median sensitivity was 100% (range 0% to 100%).  The median frequency of inconclusive results was 5.9% (range 0.9% to 36%) for CTPA and 4.0% (range 0% to 23%) for lung scintigraphy. The overall median prevalence of pulmonary embolism was 3.3% (range 0.0% to 8.7%).    Authors' conclusions Both CTPA and lung scintigraphy seem appropriate for exclusion of pulmonary embolism during pregnancy. However, the quality of the evidence mandates cautious adoption of this conclusion. Important limitations included poor reference standards, necessary assumptions in the analysis regarding inconclusive test results and the inherent inability of included studies to identify false positives. It is unclear which test has the highest accuracy. There is a need for direct comparisons between diagnostic methods, including MR, in prospective randomized diagnostic studies.",

        "Types of studies": "We considered studies with a prospective or retrospective consecutive patient series design eligible for inclusion. The minimum sample size was set at 25 per index test, in light of the a priori chance of PE of 4%; we deemed smaller studies uninformative. Studies could still be included if patients received one of multiple index tests and the choice between tests was not random and was not based on a clear protocol, as long as recruitment was consecutive. We considered inclusion consecutive if study authors described it using this or similar terms. The quality item on consecutive inclusion could still be scored 'no' on the basis of criteria provided in Table 1 (see below). In studies in which the index test could be performed multiple times for one patient, study authors reported the index test result on a patient or scan basis. In both cases, data on index test results in relation to reference results had to be extractable from the article or provided on request by study authors. We excluded case\u2010control studies.  Item plus signalling questions Criteria for scoring 'yes', 'no' and 'unclear' 1 PATIENT SELECTION Was a consecutive or random sample of patients enrolled? Was a case\u2010control design avoided? Did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions? We will score this item 'yes' when patients were consecutively or randomly selected; 90% or more were evaluated at the hospital; 5% or less of had received anticoagulant therapy within 24 hours before testing; 30% or less were given a diagnosis of comorbidity such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other pulmonary disease, malignancy or pregnancy complications (preeclampsia, syndrome of haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets or eclampsia); and 10% or less had undergone prior testing for this episode of suspected PE. We will score 'no' if one of these criteria was not met. 2 INDEX TEST Were index test results interpreted without knowledge of results of the reference standard? We will score this item 'yes' in the following cases: if study authors state that the index test interpreter was unaware of the result of the reference test; or if the order of testing was index test before reference test for every patient. Even if clinical follow\u2010up was the reference test, the order of testing has to be stated for the item to be scored 'yes'. We will score the item \u2018no\u2019 for studies in which it is stated that the interpreter of the index test was aware of the result of the reference test. In other cases, we will score this as 'unclear'. In cases of studies directly comparing the diagnostic accuracy of 2 index tests against the reference standard, these test results had to be interpreted without knowledge of the results of the comparator index test, and we will score this item similarly to the approach described above. 3 REFERENCE STANDARD Is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition? Were reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of results of the index test? We considered both PA and clinical follow\u2010up of at least 6 weeks as useful for correct classification of the target condition, the latter only if objective diagnostic tests are used in cases of suspected venous thromboembolism. We will score this item 'yes' if study authors state that reference tests were interpreted without knowledge of results of the index test. Furthermore, in cases of clinical follow\u2010up as a reference standard, any clinical suspicion of venous thrombosis during follow\u2010up needs to be followed by objective diagnostic testing (i.e. CUS or venography for suspicion of DVT, and scintigraphy, CTPA or pulmonary angiography for clinical suspicion of PE). If a patient died during follow\u2010up, we classified death as caused by PE in cases of confirmation by autopsy, in cases of an objective test positive for PE before death or if PE could not be confidently excluded as the cause of death. 4 FLOW AND TIMING Was an appropriate interval between index test(s) and reference standard provided? Did all patients receive a reference standard? Did all patients receive the same reference standard? Were all patients included in the analysis? With PA, we will consider a time period of less than 24 hours between index and reference tests as short enough to ensure that the target condition did not change between tests, either because of natural progression of the disease or because of therapeutic intervention. For studies using pulmonary angiography as the reference test, we will score this item 'yes' if the time between index and reference tests was less than 24 hours. Similarly, for studies directly comparing diagnostic accuracy of index tests, we will consider a time period of less than 24 hours between index tests and the reference test as short enough. During clinical follow\u2010up, the disease may diminish through natural progression or through intervention. Or the condition may arise during follow\u2010up if it was not present at the time of the index test. Therefore, we will score studies using clinical follow\u2010up 'no' for this item. We will score this item 'no' if less than 90% or a non\u2010random selection of patients underwent the reference test. We will score this item 'no' if less than 90% of patients who had an index test result underwent pulmonary angiography or had clinical follow\u2010up as the reference test. CTPA: computed tomography pulmonary angiography. CUS: compression ultrasonography. DVT: deep vein thrombosis. PA: pulmonary angiography. PE: pulmonary embolism.",
        "Participants": "Participants were pregnant women with clinical suspicion of PE. Conditions for suspicion of PE and confirmation of pregnancy were left to the discretion of the authors of included studies. We did not include data on postpartum or asymptomatic patients. If not all women in the study met the inclusion criteria of the present review, data had to be extractable for relevant participants. If relevant data were not extractable and could not be supplied by the study author, we excluded the study. Study populations from secondary and tertiary care settings, comprising inpatients and outpatients, were eligible for inclusion. We excluded primary care patients because test accuracy can vary with care setting.",
        "Index tests": "Studies investigating CTPA, lung scintigraphy, either planar or V/Q SPECT and either with or without ventilation scanning, and MRA as an index test were eligible for inclusion. If the patient had undergone the same index test more than once, we included only data on the first index test performed. If the first test was followed by a different index test, we included this test result. Data on original assessments of the index test result in the clinical setting were preferred over re\u2010assessments for study purposes.",
        "Target conditions": "The target condition of this review is symptomatic PE. For studies that provided multiple definitions of non\u2010diagnostic scans according to the level of the pulmonary vasculature, we considered scans as non\u2010diagnostic when they were of insufficient quality to allow visualisation of PE at segmental or more proximal levels.",
        "Reference standards": "We accepted as reference standards both pulmonary angiography and clinical follow\u2010up for the occurrence of symptomatic PE for at least six weeks. We anticipated that few or no studies would use pulmonary angiography as the reference standard. We considered a PE confirmed within three months of the index test as a positive reference test. The diagnosis of PE was confirmed on pulmonary angiography in the case of a new intraluminal filling defect, with cut\u2010off of contrast material in a vessel with diameter greater than 2.5 mm. If clinical follow\u2010up was applied as the reference standard, objective diagnostic testing had to be performed in the case of symptoms of PE. Objective criteria for the diagnosis of PE included a (new) intraluminal filling defect on CTPA; cut\u2010off of contrast material in a vessel greater than 2.5 mm in diameter; a new perfusion defect involving at least 75% of a segment, with corresponding normal ventilation (i.e. a high\u2010probability lung scan); a new non\u2010diagnostic lung scan accompanied by documentation of DVT on ultrasonography or venography; and confirmation of a new PE at autopsy. For clinical follow\u2010up, PE was also diagnosed when symptoms of PE were combined with a diagnosis of DVT. The objective criterion for the diagnosis of DVT was a (new) non\u2010compressible venous segment or a substantial increase (4 mm or more) in the diameter of the thrombus during full compression in a previously abnormal segment on ultrasonography, or a new intraluminal filling defect on venography. In case of an inconclusive index test, we considered the reference test positive if the patient was treated on clinical grounds without objective evidence of VTE on follow\u2010up. This provides a conservative estimate of both negative predictive value and sensitivity in the primary analysis. When both pulmonary angiography and clinical follow\u2010up were performed, we considered pulmonary angiography the reference standard."
