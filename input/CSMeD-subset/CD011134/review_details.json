    "title": "Blood CEA levels for detecting recurrent colorectal cancer",
    "abstract": "Background Testing for carcino\u2010embryonic antigen (CEA) in the blood is a recommended part of follow\u2010up to detect recurrence of colorectal cancer following primary curative treatment. There is substantial clinical variation in the cut\u2010off level applied to trigger further investigation.    Objectives To determine the diagnostic performance of different blood CEA levels in identifying people with colorectal cancer recurrence in order to inform clinical practice.    Search methods We conducted all searches to January 29 2014. We applied no language limits to the searches, and translated non\u2010English manuscripts. We searched for relevant reviews in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, MEDION and DARE databases. We searched for primary studies (including conference abstracts) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Science Citation Index & Conference Proceedings Citation Index \u2013 Science. We identified ongoing studies by searching WHO ICTRP and the ASCO meeting library.    Selection criteria We included cross\u2010sectional diagnostic test accuracy studies, cohort studies, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of post\u2010resection colorectal cancer follow\u2010up that compared CEA to a reference standard. We included studies only if we could extract 2 x 2 accuracy data. We excluded case\u2010control studies, as the ratio of cases to controls is determined by the study design, making the data unsuitable for assessing test accuracy.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors (BDN, IP) assessed the quality of all articles independently, discussing any disagreements. Where we could not reach consensus, a third author (BS) acted as moderator. We assessed methodological quality against QUADAS\u20102 criteria. We extracted binary diagnostic accuracy data from all included studies as 2 x 2 tables. We conducted a bivariate meta\u2010analysis. We used the xtmelogit command in Stata to produce the pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity and we also produced hierarchical summary ROC plots.    Main results In the 52 included studies, sensitivity ranged from 41% to 97% and specificity from 52% to 100%. In the seven studies reporting the impact of applying a threshold of 2.5 \u00b5g/L, pooled sensitivity was 82% (95% confidence interval (CI) 78% to 86%) and pooled specificity 80% (95% CI 59% to 92%). In the 23 studies reporting the impact of applying a threshold of 5 \u00b5g/L, pooled sensitivity was 71% (95% CI 64% to 76%) and pooled specificity 88% (95% CI 84% to 92%). In the seven studies reporting the impact of applying a threshold of 10 \u00b5g/L, pooled sensitivity was 68% (95% CI 53% to 79%) and pooled specificity 97% (95% CI 90% to 99%).    Authors' conclusions CEA is insufficiently sensitive to be used alone, even with a low threshold. It is therefore essential to augment CEA monitoring with another diagnostic modality in order to avoid missed cases. Trying to improve sensitivity by adopting a low threshold is a poor strategy because of the high numbers of false alarms generated. We therefore recommend monitoring for colorectal cancer recurrence with more than one diagnostic modality but applying the highest CEA cut\u2010off assessed (10 \u00b5g/L).",

The histological confirmation of recurrence following surgery or tissue biopsy. Routine clinical follow\u2010up used as a reference standard to confirm negative index test values where imaging is not indicated as part of the follow\u2010up schedule (standard protocols run for three to five years). We had hoped to compare the results of using these different reference standards in a sensitivity analysis. However, the majority of studies (73%) reported a composite reference standard, including more than one of the three reference standards listed above, as part of a prespecified clinical pathway and so the specific reference standard applied varied between participants within the same study. Without individual patient data, identifying the exact investigative modality applied as the reference standard was not possible and so we did not conduct the planned sensitivity analysis. We classified the chosen reference standard (or composite reference standard) used in each study as 'appropriate' (1 to 3 above), 'inappropriate' (a reference standard not included in 1 to 3 above), or 'not stated' for further subgroup analysis. There were insufficient data available to classify deaths during follow\u2010up as 'death from CRC', 'death with CRC', 'death from other causes', or 'death unspecified', as detailed in the original protocol."
