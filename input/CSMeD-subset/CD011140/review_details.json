    "abstract": "Background Age\u2010related macular degeneration (AMD) causes progressive and irreversible damage to the retina, resulting in loss of central vision. AMD is the third leading cause of irreversible visual impairment worldwide and the leading cause of blindness in industrialized countries. Since AMD is more common in older individuals, the number of affected individuals will increase significantly as the population ages. The implantable miniature telescope (IMT) is an ophthalmic device developed to improve vision in individuals who have lost vision due to AMD. Once implanted, the IMT is used to enlarge objects in the central visual field and focus them onto healthy areas of the retina not affected by AMD, allowing individuals to recognize objects that they otherwise could not see. It is unclear whether and how much the IMT can improve vision in individuals with end\u2010stage AMD.    Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of the IMT in improving visual acuity and quality of life in people with late or advanced AMD.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2017, Issue 11); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; LILACS; AMED; Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index\u2010Science; OpenSIGLE; the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (last searched 27 June 2014); ClinicalTrials.gov; the ICTRP and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Medical Devices database. The date of the search was 2 November 2017, with the exception of mRCT which is no longer in service.    Selection criteria We planned to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi\u2010randomized trials that compared the IMT versus no IMT.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed all studies for inclusion, using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.    Main results Our search yielded 1042 unique records. We removed irrelevant studies after screening titles and abstracts, and evaluated five full\u2010text reports from four studies; three were non\u2010randomized studies. There was one ongoing RCT that compared the OriLens intraocular telescope with standard low vision training in eyes with end\u2010stage AMD. Results for this study are expected in 2020.    Authors' conclusions We found no RCT or quasi\u2010RCT and can draw no conclusion about the effectiveness and safety of the IMT in improving visual acuity in individuals with late or advanced AMD. Since the IMT is typically implanted monocularly based upon which eye has better best\u2010corrected distance visual acuity, randomization between eyes within an individual may not be acceptable. Studies are needed that compare outcomes between individuals randomized to the device versus individuals not implanted, at least during study follow\u2010up, who serve as controls.",

        "Types of studies": "We planned to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared participants randomized to receive the IMT with participants randomized to not receive the IMT (Gupta 2014). We also considered quasi\u2010RCTs. In the absence of the desired types of studies, we considered including randomized within\u2010person study designs that compared eyes of individuals randomized to receive the IMT and fellow eyes that did not receive the IMT. For updates to this review, we will not consider within\u2010person studies because in practice the dominant eye is usually chosen as the eye to receive the IMT.",
        "Types of participants": "We planned to include trials that recruited participants with late/advanced or end\u2010stage bilateral wet or dry AMD. We defined late/advanced and end\u2010stage AMD as retinal findings of geographic atrophy or disciform scar with foveal involvement.",
        "Types of interventions": "The intervention was an IMT of either model, 2.2X or 3.0X. We planned to compare each model separately against no IMT.",
        "Types of outcome measures": "The proportion of participants who gained 2 or more lines of best\u2010corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) (logMAR or equivalent) in the study eye 12 months after surgery (or study enrollment for control eyes). We selected a gain of 2 or more lines as an outcome measure because it is recognized as a clinically significant important difference when assessing change in visual acuity (Beck 2007).    Change in quality of life (QoL), measured as the difference in QoL scores from time of IMT implantation (or baseline) to 12 months following surgery (or study enrollment for control eyes). We planned to assess QoL as a continuous variable using the Activity of Daily Living Scale Questionnaire, the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire, or any other validated QoL instrument.
