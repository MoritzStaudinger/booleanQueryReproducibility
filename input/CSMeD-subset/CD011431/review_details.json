    "title": "Rapid diagnostic tests for diagnosing uncomplicated non\u2010falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria in endemic countries",
    "abstract": "Background In settings where both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection cause malaria, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) need to distinguish which species is causing the patients' symptoms, as different treatments are required. Older RDTs incorporated two test lines to distinguish malaria due to P. falciparum, from malaria due to any other Plasmodium species (non\u2010falciparum). These RDTs can be classified according to which antibodies they use: Type 2 RDTs use HRP\u20102 (for P. falciparum) and aldolase (all species); Type 3 RDTs use HRP\u20102 (for P. falciparum) and pLDH (all species); Type 4 use pLDH (fromP. falciparum) and pLDH (all species).  More recently, RDTs have been developed to distinguish P. vivax parasitaemia by utilizing a pLDH antibody specific to P. vivax.    Objectives To assess the\u00a0diagnostic accuracy of RDTs for detecting non\u2010falciparum or P. vivax parasitaemia in people living in malaria\u2010endemic areas who present to ambulatory healthcare facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria, and to identify which types and brands of commercial test best detect non\u2010falciparum and P. vivax malaria.    Search methods We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases up to 31 December 2013: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; MEDLINE; EMBASE; MEDION; Science Citation Index; Web of Knowledge; African Index Medicus; LILACS; and IndMED.    Selection criteria Studies comparing RDTs with a reference standard (microscopy or polymerase chain reaction) in blood samples from a random or consecutive series of patients attending ambulatory health facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria in non\u2010falciparum endemic areas.    Data collection and analysis For each study, two review authors independently extracted a standard set of data using a tailored data extraction form. We grouped comparisons by type of RDT (defined by the combinations of antibodies used), and combined in meta\u2010analysis where appropriate. Average sensitivities and specificities are presented alongside 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).    Main results We included 47 studies enrolling 22,862 participants. Patient characteristics, sampling methods and reference standard methods were poorly reported in most studies.  RDTs detecting 'non\u2010falciparum' parasitaemia  Eleven studies evaluated Type 2 tests compared with microscopy, 25 evaluated Type 3 tests, and 11 evaluated Type 4 tests. In meta\u2010analyses, average sensitivities and specificities were 78% (95% CI 73% to 82%) and 99% (95% CI 97% to 99%) for Type 2 tests, 78% (95% CI 69% to 84%) and 99% (95% CI 98% to 99%) for Type 3 tests, and 89% (95% CI 79% to 95%) and 98% (95% CI 97% to 99%) for Type 4 tests, respectively. Type 4 tests were more sensitive than both Type 2 (P = 0.01) and Type 3 tests (P = 0.03).  Five studies compared Type 3 tests with PCR; in meta\u2010analysis, the average sensitivity and specificity were 81% (95% CI 72% to 88%) and 99% (95% CI 97% to 99%) respectively.  RDTs detecting P.vivax parasitaemia  Eight studies compared pLDH tests to microscopy; the average sensitivity and specificity were 95% (95% CI 86% to 99%) and 99% (95% CI 99% to 100%), respectively.    Authors' conclusions  RDTs designed to detect P. vivax specifically, whether alone or as part of a mixed infection, appear to be more accurate than older tests designed to distinguish P. falciparum malaria from non\u2010falciparum malaria. Compared to microscopy, these tests fail to detect around 5% ofP. vivax cases. This Cochrane Review, in combination with other published information about in vitro test performance and stability in the field, can assist policy\u2010makers to choose between the available RDTs.",

        "Types of studies": "Studies sampling a consecutive series of patients, or a randomly selected series of patients were eligible. Where the report did not explicitly state that sampling was consecutive, but we judged that consecutive sampling was most probable, we included the report. We excluded studies if they did not present sufficient data to allow us to extract absolute numbers of true positives, false positives, false negatives and true negatives. Due to resource constraints, we also excluded studies if the report did not present enough information to allow full assessment of eligibility or if the study was reported only in a non\u2010English language.",
        "Participants": "Studies recruiting people living in P. vivax,P. ovale or P. malariae endemic areas attending ambulatory healthcare settings with symptoms of uncomplicated malaria were eligible. We excluded studies if participants: were non\u2010immune people returning from endemic countries or were mainly recent migrant or displaced populations from non\u2010endemic or very low endemicity areas;    had been treated for malaria and the test was performed to assess treatment outcome;   had symptoms of severe malaria;   did not have symptoms of malaria;   were recruited through active case finding (for example, door to door surveys). were non\u2010immune people returning from endemic countries or were mainly recent migrant or displaced populations from non\u2010endemic or very low endemicity areas; had been treated for malaria and the test was performed to assess treatment outcome; had symptoms of severe malaria; did not have symptoms of malaria; were recruited through active case finding (for example, door to door surveys). In studies where only a subgroup of participants was eligible for inclusion in the review, we included the study provided that we could extract relevant data specific to that subgroup. If studies included some patients with severe malaria, and we could not extract data specific to a subgroup of participants with uncomplicated malaria, we included the study if 90% or more of the participants had uncomplicated malaria.",
        "Index tests": "Studies evaluating any immunochromatography\u2010based RDTs specifically designed to detect non\u2010falciparum or P. vivax malaria. We included commercial tests that are no longer available because they may use the same antibodies and very similar technology to tests that are currently available or may become available in the future. Older and more recently available versions of the same test, for example, OptiMAL and OptiMAL\u2010IT were included separately. We also included prototype tests which are not longer available but which correspond to one of the commercial tests.",
        "Comparator tests": "We included studies regardless of whether they made comparisons with other RDT tests or not.",
        "Target conditions": "Studies aimed to detect non\u2010falciparum or P. vivax malaria. Where no distinction was made by species, but over 98% of malaria infections were identified by the reference standard as non\u2010falciparum or P. vivax, the study was eligible for inclusion.",
        "Reference standards": "Studies were required to diagnose non\u2010falciparum or P. vivax malaria using at least one of the following two reference standards: Conventional microscopy of thick blood smears, thin blood smears or both. Presence of asexual parasites of any density was regarded as a positive smear;    PCR. Conventional microscopy of thick blood smears, thin blood smears or both. Presence of asexual parasites of any density was regarded as a positive smear; PCR. The reference standard was required to be performed using blood samples drawn at the same time as those for the index tests. Where studies used more than one reference standard, we presented data relating to comparisons with each reference standard."

        "Appendix 3. Data extraction and criteria for judgement: methodological quality": "Quality indicator     Notes      Was the spectrum of patients representative of the spectrum of patients who will receive the test in practice?       'Yes' if the inclusion criteria clearly stipulated people attending an ambulatory healthcare setting with symptoms of malaria, and the sampling method was consecutive or random.    'No' if the sample was unrepresentative of people with uncomplicated malaria in general (for example, if the majority of participants also had some other presenting health problem, such as pneumonia). Where a proportion of potential participants were excluded due to recent antimalarial use, well defined comorbidities or pregnancy, the sample could be classed as representative because these groups may also be excluded from testing as normal clinical practice, depending on local policy and practice.    'Unclear' if the source or characteristics of participants was not adequately described; or if the sampling method was not described.         Is the reference standard likely to correctly identify the target condition?      'Yes' if microscopy was undertaken by experienced microscopists with adequate laboratory facilities. Laboratory facilities were assumed to be adequate unless the study report indicated otherwise. Slides were viewed by at least two independent observers, either for all slides or for those where there are discordant results between the index and the reference test. At least 100 microscopic fields were viewed before declaring a slide negative.    'Yes' if reference standard was PCR.   'No' if microscopy was undertaken by insufficiently trained individuals, by one individual only, or in a situation with inadequate equipment, or if they viewed less than 100 microscopic fields before declaring negative.    'Unclear' if insufficient information was provided.        Is partial verification avoided?      'Yes' if all participants who received the index test also received the reference test.    'No' if not all the participants who received the index test also received the reference test.    'Unclear' if insufficient information was provided to assess this.    If not all participants received the reference test, we reported how many did not.     Is differential verification avoided?      'Yes' if the same reference test was used regardless of the index test results.   'No' if different reference tests were used depending on the results of the index test.    'Unclear' if insufficient information was provided.    If any participants received a different reference test, we reported the reasons stated for this, and how many participants were involved.      Is incorporation avoided? (the index test does not form part of the reference standard)   This should be 'Yes' for all studies, as the reference standard is defined in the inclusion criteria as microscopy or PCR.      Are the reference standard test results blinded?      'Yes' if the person undertaking the reference test did not know the results of the index tests, if the two tests were carried out in different places, or it was clear that the reference test was undertaken and the results recorded before the index test.    'No' if the same person performed both tests, or the results of the index tests were known to the person undertaking the reference tests.    'Unclear' if insufficient information was provided.        Are the index test results blinded?      'Yes' if the person undertaking the index test did not know the results of the reference tests, or if the two tests were carried out in different places, or it was clear that the index test was undertaken and the results recorded before the reference test.    'No' if the same person performed both tests, or the results of the index tests were known to the person undertaking the reference tests.    'Unclear' if insufficient information was provided.        Were uninterpretable results reported?      'Yes' if the paper stated whether there were any uninterpretable or invalid results, and how those were handled; for example whether they were repeated until a valid result was obtained, or excluded from the analysis.    'No' if the number of participants presented in the analysis did not match the number of participants originally enrolled in the study, and insufficient explanation was provided for any discrepancy.    'Unclear' if uninterpretable or invalid test results were not mentioned, but the number of participants presented in the analysis corresponded to the number of participants reported to be originally recruited into the study, or if insufficient information was given to permit this judgement; for example if the original number of participants recruited into the study was unclear.     We reported how many results were uninterpretable (of the total) and how these were handled in the analysis.      Were any withdrawals explained?      'Yes' if it was clear that no participants were excluded from the analysis (the number participants originally enrolled was clearly stated, and corresponded to the number presented in the analysis) or if exclusions were adequately described.    'No' if there were participants missing or excluded from the analysis and there was no explanation given; usually where the number of participants reported to have been enrolled and the number presented in the analysis did not correspond.    'Unclear' if not enough information was given to assess whether any participants were excluded from the analysis; for example if the original number of participants recruited into the study was unclear.     We reported how many participants were excluded from the analysis.",
