    "title": "Diagnostic accuracy of different imaging modalities following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer",
    "abstract": "Background Periampullary cancer includes cancer of the head and neck of the pancreas, cancer of the distal end of the bile duct, cancer of the ampulla of Vater, and cancer of the second part of the duodenum. Surgical resection is the only established potentially curative treatment for pancreatic and periampullary cancer. A considerable proportion of patients undergo unnecessary laparotomy because of underestimation of the extent of the cancer on computed tomography (CT) scanning. Other imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), PET\u2010CT, and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) have been used to detect local invasion or distant metastases not visualised on CT scanning which could prevent unnecessary laparotomy. No systematic review or meta\u2010analysis has examined the role of different imaging modalities in assessing the resectability with curative intent in patients with pancreatic and periampullary cancer.    Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of MRI, PET scan, and EUS performed as an add\u2010on test or PET\u2010CT as a replacement test to CT scanning in detecting curative resectability in pancreatic and periampullary cancer.    Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) databases up to 5 November 2015. Two review authors independently screened the references and selected the studies for inclusion. We also searched for articles related to the included studies by performing the \"related search\" function in MEDLINE (OvidSP) and Embase (OvidSP) and a \"citing reference\" search (by searching the articles that cite the included articles).    Selection criteria We included diagnostic accuracy studies of MRI, PET scan, PET\u2010CT, and EUS in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic and periampullary cancer on CT scan. We accepted any criteria of resectability used in the studies. We included studies irrespective of language, publication status, or study design (prospective or retrospective). We excluded case\u2010control studies.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed data extraction and quality assessment using the QUADAS\u20102 (quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies \u2010 2) tool. Although we planned to use bivariate methods for analysis of sensitivities and specificities, we were able to fit only the univariate fixed\u2010effect models for both sensitivity and specificity because of the paucity of data. We calculated the probability of unresectability in patients who had a positive index test (post\u2010test probability of unresectability in people with a positive test result) and in those with negative index test (post\u2010test probability of unresectability in people with a positive test result) using the mean probability of unresectability (pre\u2010test probability) from the included studies and the positive and negative likelihood ratios derived from the model. The difference between the pre\u2010test and post\u2010test probabilities gave the overall added value of the index test compared to the standard practice of CT scan staging alone.    Main results Only two studies (34 participants) met the inclusion criteria of this systematic review. Both studies evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of EUS in assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic cancers. There was low concerns about applicability for most domains in both studies. The overall risk of bias was low in one study and unclear or high in the second study. The mean probability of unresectable disease after CT scan across studies was 60.5% (that is 61 out of 100 patients who had resectable cancer after CT scan had unresectable disease on laparotomy). The summary estimate of sensitivity of EUS for unresectability was 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.97) and the summary estimate of specificity for unresectability was 0.80 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.96). The positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were 4.3 (95% CI 1.0 to 18.6) and 0.2 (95% CI 0.0 to 0.8) respectively. At the mean pre\u2010test probability of 60.5%, the post\u2010test probability of unresectable disease for people with a positive EUS (EUS indicating unresectability) was 86.9% (95% CI 60.9% to 96.6%) and the post\u2010test probability of unresectable disease for people with a negative EUS (EUS indicating resectability) was 20.0% (5.1% to 53.7%). This means that 13% of people (95% CI 3% to 39%) with positive EUS have potentially resectable cancer and 20% (5% to 53%) of people with negative EUS have unresectable cancer.    Authors' conclusions Based on two small studies, there is significant uncertainty in the utility of EUS in people with pancreatic cancer found to have resectable disease on CT scan. No studies have assessed the utility of EUS in people with periampullary cancer.  There is no evidence to suggest that it should be performed routinely in people with pancreatic cancer or periampullary cancer found to have resectable disease on CT scan.",

        "Types of studies": "We only included studies that provided diagnostic test accuracy data (true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative) on the different imaging modalities mentioned above in the appropriate patient population (see below) irrespective of language, publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively. However, we excluded case reports which do not provide sufficient diagnostic test accuracy data. We also planned to exclude any identified case\u2010control studies because case\u2010control studies are prone to bias (Whiting 2011).",
        "Participants": "Adults considered for curative resection of pancreatic or periampullary cancer on the basis of CT findings, who were fit to undergo major surgery. We included patients in this review irrespective of whether they underwent other imaging modalities prior to imaging modality being assessed.",
        "Index tests": "MRI, PET scan, PET\u2010CT scan, or EUS.",
        "Target conditions": "The target conditions were unresectable pancreatic and periampullary cancers, that is, we considered the imaging modality a positive test if the pancreatic or periampullary cancer is unresectable with curative intent. In these cancers it is not possible to perform curative resectability. Clinically, it may not be easy to distinguish head of pancreas cancers, ampullary cancers, and cancer of the second part of the duodenum. The treatment for these different cancers is the same, i.e. pancreatoduodenectomy and the final confirmation as to the origin of these cancers may be done after resection without definitive diagnosis of the origin of the cancer, as long as the cancers are resectable. So we considered these cancers together. There are no uniform criteria for resectability of pancreatic and periampullary cancer. Consensus exists for the definition of borderline resectable cancers (Abrams 2009). Therefore, where there is less tissue involvement than in a borderline resectable cancer the tumour can be considered as resectable. We accepted any criteria of resectability used by the study authors and acknowledge that this could potentially create a threshold effect. In general, the cancer will not be resected if liver, peritoneal, or distal nodal metastases were noted, or if the cancer had invaded important adjacent blood vessels that are beyond the criteria for borderline resectable cancers (for example, greater than 180\u00b0 involvement of the superior mesenteric artery) (Abrams 2009).",
        "Reference standards": "Confirmation of liver, peritoneal, or nodal metastatic involvement by histopathological examination of suspicious (liver, peritoneal, or nodal metastatic) lesions obtained at diagnostic laparoscopy or laparotomy. We accepted only paraffin section histology as the reference standard. In clinical practice, depending on the urgency of the results, a frozen section biopsy may be done to obtain immediate results. However, this is always confirmed by subsequent paraffin section histology (which can take several days) because frozen section biopsy is not as reliable as paraffin section histology. We also accepted the surgeon's judgement of unresectability at laparotomy when biopsy confirmation was not possible as an alternate reference standard. For example, if the tumour has invaded the adjacent blood vessels the surgeon may not resect the tumour because of the danger posed by resecting part of a large blood vessel, and so biopsy confirmation cannot be obtained. However, it should be noted that a surgeon's judgement of unresectability at laparotomy is a subjective decision and is a possible source of error in the reference standard. In the absence of an ethical and true gold standard, we accepted this as a reference standard."
