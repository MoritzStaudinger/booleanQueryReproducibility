    "title": "Triage tools for detecting cervical spine injury in pediatric trauma patients",
    "abstract": "Background Pediatric cervical spine injury (CSI) after blunt trauma is rare. Nonetheless, missing these injuries can have severe consequences. To prevent the overuse of radiographic imaging, two clinical decision tools have been developed: The National Emergency X\u2010Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) criteria and the Canadian C\u2010spine Rule (CCR). Both tools are proven to be accurate in deciding whether or not diagnostic imaging is needed in adults presenting for blunt trauma screening at the emergency department. However, little information is known about the accuracy of these triage tools in a pediatric population.    Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the NEXUS criteria and the Canadian C\u2010spine Rule in a pediatric population evaluated for CSI following blunt trauma.    Search methods We searched the following databases to 24 February 2015: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, MEDLINE Non\u2010Indexed and In\u2010Process Citations, PubMed, Embase, Science Citation Index, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Database, OpenGrey, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, the Health Technology Assessment, and the Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility.    Selection criteria We included all retrospective and prospective studies involving children following blunt trauma that evaluated the accuracy of the NEXUS criteria, the Canadian C\u2010spine Rule, or both. Plain radiography, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine, and follow\u2010up were considered as adequate reference standards.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the quality of included studies using the QUADAS\u20102 checklists. They extracted data on study design, patient characteristics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, clinical parameters, target condition, reference standard, and the diagnostic two\u2010by\u2010two table. We calculated and plotted sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value in ROC space, and constructed forest plots for visual examination of variation in test accuracy.    Main results Three cohort studies were eligible for analysis, including 3380 patients ; 96 children were diagnosed with CSI. One study evaluated the accuracy of the Canadian C\u2010spine Rule and the NEXUS criteria, and two studies evaluated the accuracy of the NEXUS criteria. The studies were of moderate quality. Due to the small number of included studies and the diverse outcomes of those studies, we could not describe a pooled estimate for the diagnostic test accuracy. The sensitivity of the NEXUS criteria of the individual studies was 0.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.90), 0.98 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.00) and 1.00 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.00). The specificity of the NEXUS criteria was 0.35 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.45), 0.54 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.62) and 0.2 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.21). For the Canadian C\u2010spine Rule the sensitivity was 0.86 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.00) and specificity was 0.15 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.23). Since the quantity of the data was small we were not able to investigate heterogeneity.    Authors' conclusions There are currently few studies assessing the diagnostic test accuracy of the NEXUS criteria and CCR in children. At the moment, there is not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of the Canadian C\u2010spine Rule to detect CSI in pediatric trauma patients following blunt trauma. The confidence interval of the sensitivity of the NEXUS criteria between the individual studies showed a wide range, with a lower limit varying from 0.18 to 0.91 with a total of four false negative test results, meaning that if physicians use the NEXUS criteria in children, there is a chance of missing CSI. Since missing CSI could have severe consequences with the risk of significant morbidity, we consider that the NEXUS criteria are at best a guide to clinical assessment, with current evidence not supporting strict or protocolized adoption of the tool into pediatric trauma care. Moreover, we have to keep in mind that the sensitivity differs among several studies, and individual confidence intervals of these studies show a wide range. Our main conclusion is therefore that additional well\u2010designed studies with large sample sizes are required to better evaluate the accuracy of the NEXUS criteria or the Canadian C\u2010spine Rule, or both, in order to determine whether they are appropriate triage tools for the clearance of the cervical spine in children following blunt trauma.",

        "Types of studies": "We included studies that compared the accuracy of the NEXUS criteria or the Canadian C\u2010spine Rule, or both, with the reference standard. We considered diagnostic studies with cross\u2010sectional or cohort designs (retrospective or prospective), and randomized controlled trials. We only included results from full reports. We preferred to include studies in which plain radiography, CT and MRI of the cervical spine was performed, since the sensitivity and specificity for the detection of ligamentous and skeletal injury differ between those imaging modalities. However, we expected this triple combination to be very rare, due to multiple limitations (radiation consequences, availability, time and costs). We therefore also included studies in which only one of the reference standards was applied. For the same reason we also included studies in which no radiographic imaging was obtained but only clinical follow\u2010up (in case of a negative index test). We expected that there would be studies in which all patients had undergone the reference standard without the index test being scored positive. We therefore also included studies in which those participants who had a negative result of the index test (no high\u2010risk factors) still underwent one of the reference standards (for example, plain radiography). We excluded case\u2010control studies because of the bias they might introduce. We preferred studies that evaluated the accuracy of the NEXUS criteria and the Canadian C\u2010spine Rule in direct comparisons to each other, but we did not exclude studies with indirect comparisons, because we expected the number of studies with direct comparisons to be limited.",
        "Participants": "We Included children between the age of 0 and 18 who underwent blunt trauma evaluation in the emergency department. We excluded patients with a history of previous surgery of the cervical spine or congenital cervical spine anomalies, or both. In case of studies with mixed populations, e.g. that included some participants in the groups and that could not be separated from the eligible participants, we tried to contact the study author to provide the data for the group of interest.",
        "Index tests": "The tests under evaluation are the NEXUS criteria and the Canadian C\u2010spine Rule, or tools in which the clinical variables contained four or more elements that are also part of the NEXUS criteria or the Canadian C\u2010spine Rule.",
        "Target conditions": "The target condition was clinically\u2010important CSI, defined as any fracture, dislocation, or ligamentous instability detectable by diagnostic imaging.",
        "Reference standards": "Radiographic imaging (plain radiography, CT or MRI or both) or clinical follow\u2010up (if the index test was scored negative) were the reference standards. Follow\u2010up was defined as clinical evaluation of the neck after removal of the neck collar (if worn) in the case of low\u2010risk patients. The first clinical follow\u2010up is performed in the emergency room during trauma evaluation. If cervical spine injury is suspected based on the index test, or after the first clinical follow\u2010up, radiographic imaging is needed to rule out or define CSI. We included patients who underwent an eligible reference standard within 72 hours of presentation at the emergency department following blunt trauma. We also included patients who did not undergo radiographic imaging, but who obtained clinical follow\u2010up directly during trauma evaluation during the first 72 hours."
