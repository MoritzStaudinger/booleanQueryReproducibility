During her treatment with methylphenidate of 20 mg/day and fluoxetine of 20 mg/day, she developed visual and auditory hallucinations.

Both diagnosed with ADHD according to criteria in the DSM‐IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition) and with IQs (intelligence quotients) > 85.

Coşkun 2008,"A paediatric patient who developed tactile and visual hallucinations with the combination of osmotic release oral system (OROS) methylphenidate and fluoxetine.

However, in either situation, it is important to note that this distressing side effect may occur even in the absence of underlying psychotic or substance‐related disorders, and clinicians' awareness is important in this issue, particularly in cases where polypharmacy is considered",,,,Patient reports/series: number of participants with serious adverse events,29,Coşkun,,,,,,
Goetz 2011,A case report of nocturnal visual hallucinations during methylphenidate treatment. A girl with ADHD and ODD (oppositional defiant disorder) experienced a 3‐hour episode of nocturnal complex bizarre visual hallucinations when treated with 18 mg of OROS methylphenidate. Nocturnal polysomnography performed 2 weeks later revealed REM (rapid eye movement) sleep reduction (17%) and fragmentation. 2 episodes of confusional arousals were recorded. This finding is typical of parasomnia associated with NREM sleep – disorder of arousal. It is hypothesized that this pre‐existing sleep impairment represents a factor of vulnerability to methylphenidate sleep side effects,,,,Patient reports/series: number of participants with serious adverse events,29,Goetz,,,,,,
Gross‐Tsur 2004,"3 children with ADHD, who were treated with low doses of methylphenidate and who developed complex visual and haptic hallucinations Comments from the study authors: The causal role of methylphenidate in the development of hallucinations was based on their appearance after ingestion of the drug, resolving after its withdrawal, and the absence of psychiatric comorbidity that could explain such phenomena. In 1 patient, the hallucinations reappeared after an inadvertent re‐challenge. Because methylphenidate is a widely used, well‐studied, and safe pharmacologic agent, physicians who prescribe methylphenidate should be aware of even rare adverse manifestations occurring at therapeutic doses",,,,Patient reports/series: number of participants with serious adverse events,29,Gross‐Tsur,,,,,,
Halevy 2009,"Several days after initiation of treatment: visual hallucinations of rats, accompanied by some tactile hallucinations. Only present during the time the patient was under the influence of methylphenidate and disappeared thereafter; immediate complete resolution upon discontinuation of the drug. Reintroduction of metyhlphenidate treatment after 2 days resulted in same complex visual hallucinations, with immediate complete resolution upon discontinuation of the drug Key conclusions of the study authors: In our case, the occurrence of hallucinations after a very low dose of methylphenidate on 2 occasions may suggest an idiosyncratic reaction. The phenomenon might also be explained by a drug‐induced dysfunction of the monoamine transmitters. Given the wide use of methylphenidate, clinicians should be aware of this possible side effect",,,,Patient reports/series: number of participants with serious adverse events,29,Halevy,,,,,,

A week later the patient visited the clinic. The therapist diagnosed her condition as a depressive state and discontinued methylphenidate. Six weeks after discontinuation of methylphenidate she was diagnosed with a schizophrenic‐like psychotic state, due to symptoms of delusions of reference and persecution, delusional mood, silly smile and thought block.

Treatment duration was 2 years. Cardiac arrest followed exercise without prior complaints of chest pain/discomfort or shortness of breath. A week before the event, he had a short episode of tachycardia. Clinical examination showed that the myocardial infarct was not acute but had occurred weeks prior to the cardiac arrest. It was thought to be due to thinning of the myocardium and an adversely remodelled left ventricle. A pacemaker was inserted and methylphenidate treatment was discontinued.

Nymark 2008,"A case report of serious cardiomyopathy during MPH treatment. Serious cardiovascular adverse effects (hypoxia and dyspnoea requiring hospitalisation) after 11 months of MPH treatment. Clinical examination showed signs of liver failure, renal failure and heart failure Comments of the study authors (Nymark et al): With a BMI of 40 our patient had extreme obesity. The hyperdynamic circulation, with increased cardiac output, was thought to be a compensatory adaptation to increased adipose tissue. This may have led to non‐ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy at the expense of left ventricular hypertrophy and remodeling as may occur in severely obese subjects (McGavock et al 2006). This is, however, unlikely as the only cause in our young patient. Human obesity is also characterized by sympathetic nervous system activation (Eikelis and Esler 2005). A possible obesity‐linked susceptibility to the toxic effect of methylphenidate could therefore play a role in the development of DCM in our patient, especially with regards to the short treatment time of one year",,,,Patient reports/series: number of participants with serious adverse events,29,Nymark,,,,,,

Both motor and vocal tics started at 40 mg/day of methylphenidate and subsided spontaneously after a year of treatment Authors' conclusion: The clinically explosive outbursts of tics were coincident with a period of treatment with methylphenidate for the treatment of ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and should not be mistaken for a symptom of the disorder",,,,Patient reports/series: number of participants with non‐serious adverse events,34,Adrian,,,,,,
Chandler 1989,"Reported non‐serious adverse events. After a month, the child's mother reported motor and phonic tics again. He was treated first with methylphenidate and then with nortriptyline. With both drugs he manifested severe facial grimacing and phonic tics; apparently, the tics had only occurred in the past when the child was treated with methylphenidate. It is, however, very difficult to attribute the tics to methylphenidate with any certainty because of the common co‐occurrence of tics in children and young people with ADHD Key conclusions of the study authors: Side effects, such as hypomania, hyperreflexia and diaphoresis, have been reported in patients being treated with a combination of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and tryptophan. By itself, L‐tryptophan may be mildly sedating. In light of such a favourable side‐effect profile, combined with no evidence for adverse interaction with stimulants, and at least some rationale from preclinical research, it should be investigated further as a means of alleviating some of the harsh consequences of psychostimulant treatment in ADHD",,,,Patient reports/series: number of participants with non‐serious adverse events,34,Chandler,,,,,,

No dyskinetic movements. Methylphenidate was discontinued and the adverse events disappeared. After a 6‐week long, drug‐free period, methylphenidate was reintroduced at 15 mg/day. No adverse events were observed Case 2: Methylphenidate introduced after discontinuation of 1 mg/day of risperidone (2 years), and produced a near manic state, irritability, agitation, racing thoughts, and distractibility. No dyskinetic movements. Methylphenidate was discontinued and the adverse events disappeared. After a couple of months, methylphenidate was reintroduced at 15 mg/day and was well‐tolerated Case 3: Methylphenidate introduced after a 1‐week medication‐free interval after treatment with 1 mg of risperidone, and produced irritability, agitation and discomfort. Methylphenidate was discontinued and the adverse events disappeared. The patient did not retry the medication Key conclusions of the study authors: This report of 3 patients draws attention to a unique condition that arises in switching from an atypical antipsychotic to stimulant medication.

The patient described in the case study seemed to exhibit characteristics related to the effects of chronic use of methylphenidate on development of human reproductive function. The unknown effects of methylphenidate are currently being studied, but as can be seen, one should exercise caution and patients should be followed closely when prescribing methylphenidate.
