    "title": "Physical exercise training for type 3 spinal muscular atrophy",
    "abstract": "Background Physical exercise training might improve muscle and cardiorespiratory function in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Optimization of aerobic capacity or other resources in residual muscle tissue through exercise may counteract the muscle deterioration that occurs secondary to motor neuron loss and inactivity in SMA. There is currently no evidence synthesis available on physical exercise training in people with SMA type 3.    Objectives To assess the effects of physical exercise training on functional performance in people with SMA type 3, and to identify any adverse effects.    Search methods On 8 May 2018, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and LILACS. On 25 April 2018 we searched NHSEED, DARE, and ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP for ongoing trials.    Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi\u2010RCTs lasting at least 12 weeks that compared physical exercise training (strength training, aerobic exercise training, or both) to placebo, standard or usual care, or another type of non\u2010physical intervention for SMA type 3. Participants were adults and children from the age of five years with a diagnosis of SMA type 3 (Kugelberg\u2010Welander syndrome), confirmed by genetic analysis.    Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.   Main results We included one RCT that studied the effects of a six\u2010month, home\u2010based, combined muscle strength and recumbent cycle ergometry training program versus usual care in 14 ambulatory people with SMA. The age range of the participants was between 10 years and 48 years. The study was evaluator\u2010blinded, but personnel and participants could not be blinded to the intervention, which placed the results at a high risk of bias. Participants performed strength training as prescribed, but 50% of the participants did not achieve the intended aerobic exercise training regimen. The trial used change in walking distance on the six\u2010minute walk test as a measure of function; a minimal detectable change is 24.0 m. The change from baseline to six months' follow\u2010up in the training group (9.4 m) was not detectably different from the change in the usual care group (\u20100.14 m) (mean difference (MD) 9.54 m, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u201083.04 to 102.12; N = 12). Cardiopulmonary exercise capacity, assessed by the change from baseline to six months' follow\u2010up in peak oxygen uptake (VO2max) was similar in the training group (\u20100.12 mL/kg/min) and the usual care group (\u20101.34 mL/kg/min) (MD 1.22 mL/kg/min, 95% CI \u20102.16 to 4.6; N = 12). A clinically meaningful increase in VO2max is 3.5 mL/kg/min.  The trial assessed function on the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale \u2010 Expanded (HFMSE), which has a range of possible scores from 0 to 66, with an increase of 3 or more points indicating clinically meaningful improvement. The HFMSE score in the training group increased by 2 points from baseline to six months' follow\u2010up, with no change in the usual care group (MD 2.00, 95% CI \u20102.06 to 6.06; N = 12). The training group showed a slight improvement in muscle strength, expressed as the manual muscle testing (MMT) total score, which ranges from 28 (weakest) to 280 (strongest). The change from baseline in MMT total score was 6.8 in the training group compared to \u20105.14 in the usual care group (MD 11.94, 95% CI \u20103.44 to 27.32; N = 12).  The trial stated that training had no statistically significant effects on fatigue and quality of life. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low because of study limitations and imprecision. The study did not assess the effects of physical exercise training on physical activity levels. No study\u2010related serious adverse events or adverse events leading to withdrawal occurred, but we cannot draw wider conclusions from this very low\u2010certainty evidence.    Authors' conclusions It is uncertain whether combined strength and aerobic exercise training is beneficial or harmful in people with SMA type 3, as the quality of evidence is very low. We need well\u2010designed and adequately powered studies using protocols that meet international standards for the development of training interventions, in order to improve our understanding of the exercise response in people with SMA type 3 and eventually develop exercise guidelines for this condition.",

        "Types of studies": "We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi\u2010RCTs. Quasi\u2010RCTs are studies that use a quasi\u2010random method to allocate participants to groups, such as alternation, date of birth, or case record number (Higgins 2011). In the 'Discussion' section, we described relevant cross\u2010over studies, case control studies and multi\u2010 and single\u2010case reports that fulfilled the same standards as eligible RCTs regarding diagnostic criteria, description of intervention, and outcome measures. We considered trials available in any language, whether available as full\u2010text articles, abstracts, or unpublished data only.",
        "Types of participants": "We included studies in children from the age of five years and adults with a diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 3 (Kugelberg\u2010Welander syndrome) who fulfilled the clinical criteria and had a deletion or mutation of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene (5q11.2\u201013.2) confirmed by genetic analysis (Lefebvre 1995). Studies of mixed populations, e.g. studies that include mixed neuromuscular diseases or mixed SMA types, were only eligible for inclusion in the review if they reported results for SMA type 3 separately.",
        "Types of interventions": "We included trials that used any form of physical exercise training of skeletal muscles, including aerobic exercise and strength training, carried out for a period of at least 12 weeks, compared with placebo, standard or usual care, or another type of non\u2010physical intervention. We included trials that provided co\u2010interventions to each group equally. We excluded studies of respiratory muscle training or that used a non\u2010exercised limb as a control. We included trials that used training programs standardized on frequency, intensity, time, and type of training, with an incremental exercise protocol.",

        "Appendix 12. Additional methods specified in the protocol": "We were unable to implement the following methods described in our protocol (Bartels 2016).   Data extraction and management When reports require translation, the translator will extract data directly, using a data extraction form, or we will extract data from the translation provided. Where possible, a review author will check numerical data in the translation against the study report.  To minimize bias in the review process, the review authors will not screen studies for inclusion, extract data, or assess the risk of bias if they are also an author of the study. In such circumstances, we will involve a third review author (JdG).    Measures of treatment effect We will report dichotomous data as risk ratios and continuous data as mean differences, or as standardized mean differences (SMDs) for outcomes that are conceptually the same but measured in different ways in different studies. We will report corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). When different trials use comparable but different scales to measure the same outcome, we will report pooled results using SMD with 95% CI, ensuring that data from scales are pooled with a consistent direction of effect. We will convert scores on cycle ergometry and treadmill testing, fatigue, and quality of life to percentage scores or Z\u2010scores for pooling. For disability and impairment measures, we will consider an SMD 0.4 to 0.7 (moderate change) clinically significant, whereas in quality of life and fatigue measures, we will consider an SMD less than 0.4 but greater than 0.2 clinically significant.  We will undertake meta\u2010analyses only when this is meaningful, that is, if the treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question are similar enough for pooling to make sense. We did not plan to combine scores on dynamometry and MMT, or scores on questionnaires and accelerometry, but to report these different measurements separately. We will narratively describe skewed data reported as medians and interquartile ranges.    Dealing with missing data If we are unable to obtain missing outcome data by contact with trial authors or sponsors, and we consider the methods used to deal with missing data to have introduced serious bias, we will explore the impact of inclusion of such trials in the overall assessment of results by a sensitivity analysis.    Unit of analysis issues Where multiple trial arms are reported in a single trial, we will include only the eligible arms. If two eligible comparisons (e.g. drug A versus placebo and drug B versus the same placebo group) are combined in the same meta\u2010analysis, we will avoid double\u2010counting by creating a single pair\u2010wise comparison as recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions or, alternatively, halve the control group (Higgins 2011).    Assessment of heterogeneity We will use the I\u00b2 statistic to measure heterogeneity among the trials in each analysis. If we identify substantial unexplained heterogeneity we will report it and explore possible causes by prespecified subgroup analysis. We will use the rough guide to interpretation as outlined in Chapter 11 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, as follows:     0% to 40%: might not be important;   30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity;   50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity;   75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity.    We will avoid the use of absolute cut\u2010off values, but interpret I\u00b2 in relation to the size and direction of effects and strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. P value from the Chi\u2010squared test, or CI for I\u00b2) (Deeks 2011).  If we identify substantial unexplained heterogeneity (e.g. over 50%), we will report it and explore possible causes by prespecified subgroup analysis.    Assessment of reporting bias If we are able to pool more than 10 trials, we will create and examine a funnel plot to explore possible small study biases.    Data synthesis We expect heterogeneity among trials and we will use a random\u2010effects model. We will perform a sensitivity analysis with a fixed\u2010effect model.  If the review includes more than one comparison that cannot be included in the same analysis, we will report the results for each comparison separately.    Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity We plan to perform the following subgroup analyses.    SMA type 3a and SMA type 3b.   Children (aged <18 years) and adults.    We will use primary and secondary outcome measures in all subgroup analyses. We will use the formal test for subgroup interactions in RevMan (RevMan 2014).    Sensitivity analysis We plan to undertake the following sensitivity analyses.    Repeat the analysis by excluding unpublished studies (if there are any).   Repeat the analysis by excluding studies at high risk of bias (sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of personnel, and outcome assessment).    If there are one or more very large trials, we will repeat the analysis by excluding these large trials to examine how much they dominate the results.",
