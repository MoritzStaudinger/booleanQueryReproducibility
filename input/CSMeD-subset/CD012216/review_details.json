    "title": "18F PET with florbetapir for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)",
    "abstract": "Background 18F\u2010florbetapir uptake by brain tissue measured by positron emission tomography (PET) is accepted by regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agencies (EMA) for assessing amyloid load in people with dementia. Its added value is mainly demonstrated by excluding Alzheimer's pathology in an established dementia diagnosis. However, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA\u2010AA) revised the diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease and confidence in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease may be increased when using amyloid biomarkers tests like 18F\u2010florbetapir. These tests, added to the MCI core clinical criteria, might increase the diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) of a testing strategy. However, the DTA of 18F\u2010florbetapir to predict the progression from MCI to Alzheimer\u2019s disease dementia (ADD) or other dementias has not yet been systematically evaluated.    Objectives To determine the DTA of the 18F\u2010florbetapir PET scan for detecting people with MCI at time of performing the test who will clinically progress to ADD, other forms of dementia (non\u2010ADD), or any form of dementia at follow\u2010up.    Search methods This review is current to May 2017. We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), BIOSIS Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), Web of Science Core Collection, including the Science Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science) and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/). We also searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia & Cognitive Improvement Group\u2019s specialised register of dementia studies (http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois/). We checked the reference lists of any relevant studies and systematic reviews, and performed citation tracking using the Science Citation Index to identify any additional relevant studies. No language or date restrictions were applied to the electronic searches.    Selection criteria We included studies that had prospectively defined cohorts with any accepted definition of MCI at time of performing the test and the use of 18F\u2010florbetapir scan to evaluate the DTA of the progression from MCI to ADD or other forms of dementia. In addition, we only selected studies that applied a reference standard for Alzheimer\u2019s dementia diagnosis, for example, National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS\u2010ADRDA) or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\u2010IV (DSM\u2010IV) criteria.    Data collection and analysis We screened all titles and abstracts identified in electronic\u2010database searches. Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data to create two\u2010by\u2010two tables, showing the binary test results cross\u2010classified with the binary reference standard. We used these data to calculate sensitivities, specificities, and their 95% confidence intervals. Two independent assessors performed quality assessment using the QUADAS\u20102 tool plus some additional items to assess the methodological quality of the included studies.    Main results We included three studies, two of which evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD, and one evaluated the progression from MCI to any form of dementia.  Progression from MCI to ADD was evaluated in 448 participants. The studies reported data on 401 participants with 1.6 years of follow\u2010up and in 47 participants with three years of follow\u2010up. Sixty\u2010one (15.2%) participants converted at 1.6 years follow\u2010up; nine (19.1%) participants converted at three years of follow\u2010up.  Progression from MCI to any form of dementia was evaluated in five participants with 1.5 years of follow\u2010up, with three (60%) participants converting to any form of dementia.  There were concerns regarding applicability in the reference standard in all three studies. Regarding the domain of flow and timing, two studies were considered at high risk of bias.  MCI to ADD; Progression from MCI to ADD in those with a follow\u2010up between two to less than four years had a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI 30 to 93) and a specificity of 71% (95% CI 54 to 85) by visual assessment (n = 47, 1 study).  Progression from MCI to ADD in those with a follow\u2010up between one to less than two years had a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 78 to 95) and a specificity of 58% (95% CI 53 to 64) by visual assessment, and a sensitivity of 87% (95% CI 76 to 94) and a specificity of 51% (95% CI 45 to 56) by quantitative assessment by the standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR)(n = 401, 1 study).  MCI to any form of dementia; Progression from MCI to any form of dementia in those with a follow\u2010up between one to less than two years had a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI 9 to 99) and a specificity of 50% (95% CI 1 to 99) by visual assessment (n = 5, 1 study).  MCI to any other forms of dementia (non\u2010ADD); There was no information regarding the progression from MCI to any other form of dementia (non\u2010ADD).    Authors' conclusions Although sensitivity was good in one included study, considering the poor specificity and the limited data available in the literature, we cannot recommend routine use of 18F\u2010florbetapir PET in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to ADD.  Because of the poor sensitivity and specificity, limited number of included participants, and the limited data available in the literature, we cannot recommend its routine use in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to any form of dementia.  Because of the high financial costs of 18F\u2010florbetapir, clearly demonstrating the DTA and standardising the process of this modality are important prior to its wider use.",

        "Types of studies": "We included longitudinal studies that had prospectively defined cohorts with any accepted definition of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), as outlined below, at time of performing the 18F\u2010florbetapir A\u03b2 scan and a reference standard (see Index tests and Reference standards below). We obtained the results at the follow\u2010up of the studies. These studies had to employ delayed verification of progression to dementia and were sometimes labelled as 'delayed verification cross\u2010sectional studies' (Bossuyt 2008; Knottnerus 2002). We included case\u2010control studies when they incorporated a delayed verification design. This occurred in the context of a cohort study, so these studies were invariably diagnostic\u2010nested case\u2010control studies.",
        "Participants": "Participants recruited and clinically classified as having MCI at time of performing the test were eligible for inclusion. We established the diagnosis of MCI using the Petersen criteria or revised Petersen criteria (Petersen 1999; Petersen 2004; Winblad 2004), the criteria included in the Matthews study (Matthews 2008), CDR = 0.5 (CDR structured interviews collects information from both the collateral source and the subject regarding memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care, where the range of possible scores varies from none = 0 point to severe = 3 points) (Morris 1993), the National Institute on Aging\u2010Alzheimer's Association (NIA\u2010AA) core clinical criteria (Albert 2011), or a combination. We excluded studies that included people with MCI possibly caused by any of the following: Current or a history of alcohol or drug abuse.   Central nervous system (CNS) trauma (e.g. subdural hematoma), tumour, or infection.   Other neurological conditions (e.g. Parkinson\u2019s or Huntington\u2019s diseases). Regarding Parkinson's disease, many of the studies specifically excluded Parkison's disease patients from the group with mild cognitive impairment. This specific group of patients is complex in both regards to defining neuropathology and in determination of functional decline. For these reasons, this group of patients needs to be addressed in specific studies. Current or a history of alcohol or drug abuse. Central nervous system (CNS) trauma (e.g. subdural hematoma), tumour, or infection. Other neurological conditions (e.g. Parkinson\u2019s or Huntington\u2019s diseases). Regarding Parkinson's disease, many of the studies specifically excluded Parkison's disease patients from the group with mild cognitive impairment. This specific group of patients is complex in both regards to defining neuropathology and in determination of functional decline. For these reasons, this group of patients needs to be addressed in specific studies.",
        "Index tests": "The index test of this SR was the 18F\u2010florbetapir biomarker test. We used the criteria and cut\u2010off values for test positivity as reported in the included studies. We considered positivity for 18F\u2010florbetapir A\u03b2 scan uptake and retention exceeding a certain threshold.",
        "Target conditions": "There were three target conditions in this SR: Alzheimer\u2019s disease dementia (ADD) (progression from MCI to ADD).   Any other forms of dementia (progression from MCI to any other forms of non\u2010ADD).   Any form of dementia (progression from MCI to any form of dementia). Alzheimer\u2019s disease dementia (ADD) (progression from MCI to ADD). Any other forms of dementia (progression from MCI to any other forms of non\u2010ADD). Any form of dementia (progression from MCI to any form of dementia).",
        "Reference standards": "The reference standard was the progression to the target conditions evaluated by a physician with expertise in the dementia field (preferably, a geriatrician, psychiatrist, or neurologist). For the purpose of this SR, we accepted several definitions of ADD. We included studies that applied the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS\u2010ADRDA) criteria (McKhann 1984), the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria (APA 1987; APA 1994), and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (ICD\u201010) criteria for ADD. Notably, different iterations of these standards may not be directly comparable over time (e.g. APA 1987 versus APA 1994). Moreover, the validity of the diagnoses may vary with the degree or manner in which the criteria have been operationalised (e.g. individual clinician versus algorithm versus consensus determination). We considered all these issues when we interpreted the results. Similarly, we accepted differing clinical definitions of other dementias. For Lewy body dementia, the reference standard is the McKeith criteria (McKeith 1996; McKeith 2005); for frontotemporal dementia, the Lund criteria (Boxer 2005; Brun 1994; Neary 1998), the DSM criteria (APA 1987; APA 1994), the ICD criteria (ICD\u201010), or the International Behavioural Variant FTD Criteria Consortium (Rascovsky 2011); and for vascular dementia, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Association Internationale pour la Recherch\u00e9 et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS\u2010AIREN) criteria (Rom\u00e1n 1993), the DSM criteria (APA 1987; APA 1994), or the ICD criteria (ICD\u201010). The time interval over which progression from MCI to ADD (or other forms of dementia) occurs is very important. We used one year as the minimum period of delay in the verification of the diagnosis (the time between the assessment at which a diagnosis of MCI is made and the assessment at which the diagnosis of dementia is made)."

        "Appendix 1. Glossary": "Aetiology: the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition.  Amyloid beta (A\u03b2): an amyloid that is derived from a larger precursor protein and is the primary component of plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.  Biomarker: measurable and quantifiable biological parameters (e.g., specific enzyme concentration, specific hormone concentration, presence of biological substances) which serve as indices for health\u2010 and physiology\u2010related assessments, such as disease risk, psychiatric disorders, environmental exposure and its effects, disease diagnosis; metabolic processes; etc.  Bolus: a single dose of a drug or other medicinal preparation given all at once.  Cingulate cortex: one of the convolutions on the medial surface of the cerebral hemispheres.  Cortical: the thin layer of grey matter on the surface of the cerebral hemispheres. It reaches its highest development in humans and is responsible for intellectual faculties and higher mental functions.  Epiphenomenon: A secondary effect or by\u2010product. A secondary symptom or pathology, occurring simultaneously with a disease or condition but not directly related to it.  Frontotemporal: relating to the frontal and the temporal cerebral lobes.  Histopathology: the study of changes in tissues caused by disease.  Hypothyroidism: a syndrome that results from abnormally low secretion of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland.  Index test: the test under evaluation.  In vivo: (of processes) performed or taking place in a living organism.  Ligand: a molecule that binds to another molecule, used especially to refer to a small molecule that binds specifically to a larger molecule, e.g., an antigen binding to an antibody, a hormone or neurotransmitter binding to a receptor, or a substrate or allosteric effector binding to an enzyme.  Neuritic plaques: accumulations of extracellularly deposited amyloid fibrils within tissues. Is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.  Neurofibrillary tangles: abnormal structures located in various parts of the brain and composed of dense arrays of paired helical filaments (neurofilaments and microtubules). Are aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein that are most commonly known as a primary marker of Alzheimer's disease.  Parietal lobe: upper central part of the cerebral hemisphere. It is located anterior to the occipital lobe, and superior to the temporal lobes.  Positron: an extremely small piece of matter with a positive electrical charge, having the same mass as an electron.  Precuneus: is a part of the parietal lobe of the brain, lying on the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere.  Prodromal: relating to prodrome; indicating an early stage of a disease.  Radionuclide (sometimes called a radioisotope or isotope): is a chemical which emits a type of radioactivity called gamma rays. The radioactivity can be detected by special scanners.  Reference standard: the best available method for establishing the presence or absence of the target condition.  Sensitivity: a measure of a test\u2019s ability to correctly detect people with the disease. It is the proportion of diseased cases that are correctly identified by the test. It is calculated as follows: Sensitivity = Number with disease who have a positive test/Number with disease.  Specificity: a measure of a test\u2019s ability to correctly identify people who do not have the disease. It is the proportion of people without the target disease who are correctly identified by the test. It is calculated as follows: Specificity = Number without disease who have a negative test/Number without disease.  Stilbene: organic compounds that contain 1,2\u2010diphenylethylene as a functional group.  Target condition: the disease or condition that the index test is expected to detect.  Temporal lobe: lower lateral part of the cerebral hemisphere responsible for auditory, olfactory, and semantic processing. It is located inferior to the lateral fissure and anterior to the occipital lobe.  Vascular: relating to, affecting, or consisting of a vessel or vessels, especially those which carry blood.",

These statements are designed for use with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS\u20102) tool and are based on the guidance for quality assessment of DTA reviews of Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) in dementia (Quinn 2014). In assessing individual items, the score of unclear should only be given if there is genuine uncertainty. In these situations, we contacted the relevant study teams for additional information. Whenever we scored one question as high risk of bias, we considered the study as having a high risk of bias.  Table 5. Anchoring statements to assist with the 'Risk of bias' assessment         Question     Response and weighting     Explanation       Patient selection      Was the sampling method appropriate?   No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias    Where sampling is used, the designs least likely to cause bias are consecutive sampling or random sampling. Sampling that is based on volunteers or selecting subjects from a clinic or research resource is prone to bias.      Was a case\u2010control or similar design avoided?    No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias    Designs similar to case\u2010control that may introduce bias are those designs where the study team deliberately increase or decrease the proportion of subjects with the target condition, which may not be representative. Some case\u2010control methods may already be excluded if they mix subjects from various settings.      Are exclusion criteria described and appropriate?   No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias    We automatically graded the study as unclear if the study authors did not detail exclusions (pending contact with study authors).  Where a study details exclusions, we graded the study as 'low risk' if we considered exclusions to be appropriate. Certain exclusions common to many studies of dementia are: medical instability; terminal disease; alcohol/substance misuse; concomitant psychiatric diagnosis; other neurodegenerative conditions.  Exclusions are not appropriate if they comprise \u2018difficult to diagnose\u2019 patients. We labelled post\u2010hoc and inappropriate exclusions as at 'high risk' of bias.      Index test      Was the 18F\u2010florbetapir PET ligand for A\u03b2 biomarker's  assessment/interpretation performed without knowledge of clinical dementia diagnosis?   No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias    Terms such as 'blinded' or 'independently and without knowledge of' are sufficient and full details of the blinding procedure are not required. Interpretation of the results of the index test may be influenced by knowledge of the results of the reference standard. If the index test is always interpreted prior to the reference standard, then the person interpreting the index test cannot be aware of the results of the reference standard and so this item could be rated as \u2018yes\u2019. For certain index tests, the result is objective and knowledge of the reference standard should not influence the result, e.g. level of protein in cerebrospinal fluid; in this instance, the quality assessment may be 'low risk' even if blinding was not achieved.      Was the 18F\u2010florbetapir PET ligand for A\u03b2 biomarker's  threshold prespecified?   No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias    For scales and biomarkers, there is often a reference point (in units or categories) above which subjects are classified as 'test\u2010positive'; this may be referred to as the threshold, clinical cut\u2010off, or dichotomisation point. A study is classified at high risk of bias if the study authors define the optimal cut\u2010off post\u2010hoc based on their own study data because selecting the threshold to maximise sensitivity and/or specificity may lead to overoptimistic measures of test performance. Certain papers may use an alternative methodology for analysis that does not use thresholds and these papers should be classified as not applicable.      Was the 18F\u2010florbetapir PET ligand for A\u03b2 scan interpretation done by a trained reader physician?    No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias    If a trained reader physician performed the scan interpretation, we scored this item as \u2019yes\u2019.  If no definition of trained reader was done, we scored this item as \u2019unclear\u2019. If a nontrained reader physician performed the scan interpretation, we scored this item as \u2019no\u2019.      Did the study provide a clear definition of what was considered to be a 18F\u2010florbetapir PET ligand for A\u03b2 biomarker\u2019s positive result?    No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias    If the study clearly stated the definition of a positive result (e.g. SUV), we scored this item as \u2019yes\u2019.  If the study did not give a definition of what it considered a positive result or the definition of a positive result varied between the participants, we scored this item as \u2019no\u2019.  If the study gave insufficient information to permit judgement, we scored the item as \u2019unclear\u2019.       Reference standard      Is the assessment used for clinical diagnosis of dementia acceptable?    No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias    Commonly used international criteria to assist with clinical diagnosis of dementia included those detailed in DSM\u2010IV and ICD\u201010. Criteria specific to dementia subtypes included but were not limited to NINCDS\u2010ADRDA criteria for Alzheimer\u2019s dementia; McKeith criteria for Lewy body dementia; Lund criteria and International Behavioural Variant FTD Criteria Consortium for frontotemporal dementia; and the NINDS\u2010AIREN criteria for vascular dementia. Where the criteria used for assessment were not familiar to the review authors or the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement group (\u2018unclear\u2019), we classified this item as 'high risk of bias'.      Were clinical assessments for dementia performed without knowledge of the 18F\u2010florbetapir PET ligand for A\u03b2 biomarker?    No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias    Terms such as 'blinded' or 'independently and without knowledge of' were sufficient and full details of the blinding procedure were not required. Interpretation of the results of the reference standard may be influenced by knowledge of the results of the index test.       Patient flow      Was there an appropriate interval between 18F\u2010florbetapir PET ligand for A\u03b2 biomarker and clinical dementia assessment?    No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias    As we test the accuracy of the 18F\u2010florbetapir PET ligand for A\u03b2 biomarker for MCI progression to dementia, there will always be a delay between the index test and the reference standard assessments. The time between the reference standard and the index test will influence the accuracy (Geslani 2005; Okello 2007; Visser 2006), and therefore we noted time as a separate variable (both within and between studies) and will test its influence on the diagnostic accuracy. We have set a minimum mean time to follow\u2010up assessment of 1 year. If more than 16% of subjects have assessment for MCI progression before nine months, this item was scored \u2018no\u2019.      Did all subjects get the same assessment for dementia regardless 18F\u2010florbetapir PET ligand for A\u03b2 biomarker?    No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias    There may be scenarios where participants who score 'test\u2010positive' on the index test have a more detailed assessment. Where dementia assessment differs between participants, this should be classified as high risk of bias.      Were all patients who received 18F\u2010florbetapir PET ligand for A\u03b2 biomarker\u2019s assessment included in the final analysis?    No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias    If the number of patients enrolled differs from the number of patients included in the 2 \u00d7 2 table, then there is the potential for bias. If patients lost to dropouts differ systematically from those who remain, then estimates of test performance may differ. If there are dropouts, these should be accounted for; a maximum proportion of dropouts for a study to remain at low risk of bias has been specified as 20%.      Were missing 18F\u2010florbetapir PET ligand for A\u03b2 biomarker's results reported?    No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias    Where missing or uninterpretable results are reported, and if there is substantial attrition (we have set an arbitrary value of 50% missing data), we will score this as \u2018no\u2019. If the study did not report these results, we scored this as \u2018unclear\u2019 and we contacted the study authors.      Was the study with 18F\u2010florbetapir PET ligand for A\u03b2 biomarker free of commercial funding?    No = high risk of bias Yes = low risk of bias Unclear = unclear risk of bias    If the funding source is clearly stated and is not commercial, this should be scored as \u2018no\u2019.  If the funding source is clearly stated and is commercial, this should be scored as \u2019yes \u2019.  If not enough information is given to assess whether the funding source is commercial, the scored is \u2019unclear\u2019.       Anchoring statements to assist with assessment for applicability       Question     Explanation      Were included patients representative of the general population of interest?    The included patients should match the intended population as described in the review question. The review authors should consider population in terms of symptoms; pretesting; potential disease prevalence; setting. If there is a clear ground for suspecting an unrepresentative spectrum, the item should be rated poor applicability.       Index test      Were sufficient data on 18F\u2010florbetapir PET ligand for A\u03b2 biomarker\u2019s application given for the test to be repeated in an independent study?    Variation in technology, test execution, and test interpretation may affect estimate of accuracy. In addition, the background, and training/expertise of the assessor should be reported and taken in consideration. If 18F\u2010florbetapir PET ligand for A\u03b2 biomarker was not performed consistently, this item should be rated poor applicability.       Reference standard      Was clinical diagnosis of dementia made in a manner similar to current clinical practice?   For many reviews, inclusion criteria and 'Risk of bias' assessments will already have assessed the dementia diagnosis. For certain reviews, an applicability statement relating to the reference standard may not be applicable. There is the possibility that a form of dementia assessment, although valid, may diagnose a far larger proportion of people with disease than usual clinical practice. In this instance, the item should be rated poor applicability.
