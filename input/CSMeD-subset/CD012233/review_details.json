    "title": "Transabdominal ultrasound and endoscopic ultrasound for diagnosis of gallbladder polyps",
    "abstract": "Background Approximately 0.6% to 4% of cholecystectomies are performed because of gallbladder polyps. The decision to perform cholecystectomy is based on presence of gallbladder polyp(s) on transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS) or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), or both. These polyps are currently considered for surgery if they grow more than 1 cm. However, non\u2010neoplastic polyps (pseudo polyps) do not need surgery, even when they are larger than 1 cm. True polyps are neoplastic, either benign (adenomas) or (pre)malignant (dysplastic polyps/carcinomas). True polyps need surgery, especially if they are premalignant or malignant. There has been no systematic review and meta\u2010analysis on the accuracy of TAUS and EUS in the diagnosis of gallbladder polyps, true gallbladder polyps, and (pre)malignant polyps.    Objectives To summarise and compare the accuracy of transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for the detection of gallbladder polyps, for differentiating between true and pseudo gallbladder polyps, and for differentiating between dysplastic polyps/carcinomas and adenomas/pseudo polyps of the gallbladder in adults.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, and trial registrations (last date of search 09 July 2018). We had no restrictions regarding language, publication status, or prospective or retrospective nature of the studies.    Selection criteria Studies reporting on the diagnostic accuracy data (true positive, false positive, false negative and true negative) of the index test (TAUS or EUS or both) for detection of gallbladder polyps, differentiation between true and pseudo polyps, or differentiation between dysplastic polyps/carcinomas and adenomas/pseudo polyps. We only accepted histopathology after cholecystectomy as the reference standard, except for studies on diagnosis of gallbladder polyp. For the latter studies, we also accepted repeated imaging up to six months by TAUS or EUS as the reference standard.    Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened abstracts, selected studies for inclusion, and collected data from each study. The quality of the studies was evaluated using the QUADAS\u20102 tool. The bivariate random\u2010effects model was used to obtain summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity, to compare diagnostic performance of the index tests, and to assess heterogeneity.    Main results A total of 16 studies were included. All studies reported on TAUS and EUS as separate tests and not as a combination of tests. All studies were at high or unclear risk of bias, ten studies had high applicability concerns in participant selection (because of inappropriate participant exclusions) or reference standards (because of lack of follow\u2010up for non\u2010operated polyps), and three studies had unclear applicability concerns in participant selection (because of high prevalence of gallbladder polyps) or index tests (because of lack of details on ultrasound equipment and performance). A meta\u2010analysis directly comparing results of TAUS and EUS in the same population could not be performed because only limited studies executed both tests in the same participants. Therefore, the results below were obtained only from indirect test comparisons. There was significant heterogeneity amongst all comparisons (target conditions) on TAUS and amongst studies on EUS for differentiating true and pseudo polyps.  Detection of gallbladder polyps: Six studies (16,260 participants) used TAUS. We found no studies on EUS. The summary sensitivity and specificity of TAUS for the detection of gallbladder polyps was 0.84 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.95) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.98), respectively. In a cohort of 1000 people, with a 6.4% prevalence of gallbladder polyps, this would result in 37 overdiagnosed and seven missed gallbladder polyps.  Differentiation between true polyp and pseudo gallbladder polyp: Six studies (1078 participants) used TAUS; the summary sensitivity was 0.68 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.85) and the summary specificity was 0.79 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.91). Three studies (209 participants) used EUS; the summary sensitivity was 0.85 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.97) and the summary specificity was 0.90 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.96). In a cohort of 1000 participants with gallbladder polyps, with 10% having true polyps, this would result in 189 overdiagnosed and 32 missed true polyps by TAUS, and 90 overdiagnosed and 15 missed true polyps by EUS. There was no evidence of a difference between the diagnostic accuracy of TAUS and EUS (relative sensitivity 1.06, P = 0.70, relative specificity 1.15, P = 0.12).  Differentiation between dysplastic polyps/carcinomas and adenomas/pseudo polyps of the gallbladder: Four studies (1,009 participants) used TAUS; the summary sensitivity was 0.79 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.90) and the summary specificity was 0.89 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.97). Three studies (351 participants) used EUS; the summary sensitivity was 0.86 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.92) and the summary specificity was 0.92 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.95). In a cohort of 1000 participants with gallbladder polyps, with 5% having a dysplastic polyp/carcinoma, this would result in 105 overdiagnosed and 11 missed dysplastic polyps/carcinomas by TAUS and 76 overdiagnosed and seven missed dysplastic polyps/carcinomas by EUS. There was no evidence of a difference between the diagnostic accuracy of TAUS and EUS (log likelihood test P = 0.74).    Authors' conclusions Although TAUS seems quite good at discriminating between gallbladder polyps and no polyps, it is less accurate in detecting whether the polyp is a true or pseudo polyp and dysplastic polyp/carcinoma or adenoma/pseudo polyp. In practice, this would lead to both unnecessary surgeries for pseudo polyps and missed cases of true polyps, dysplastic polyps, and carcinomas. There was insufficient evidence that EUS is better compared to TAUS in differentiating between true and pseudo polyps and between dysplastic polyps/carcinomas and adenomas/pseudo polyps. The conclusions are based on heterogeneous studies with unclear criteria for diagnosis of the target conditions and studies at high or unclear risk of bias. Therefore, results should be interpreted with caution. Further studies of high methodological quality, with clearly stated criteria for diagnosis of gallbladder polyps, true polyps, and dysplastic polyps/carcinomas are needed to accurately determine diagnostic accuracy of EUS and TAUS.",

We excluded case\u2010control studies because these studies are prone to bias (Whiting 2011). We included only studies that reported on, or those from which we could extract data on, true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives (diagnostic test accuracy information). In case of multiple publications, we included the study report with the highest number of participants.",

        "Reference standards": "We used histopathological analysis of the resected gallbladder after cholecystectomy as the reference standard for all three target conditions. It enables direct analysis of the entire gallbladder, its content, and the presence and pathological entity of the gallbladder polyp, and can be considered the best reference standard. However, cholecystectomy may not be performed in people without gallbladder polyps or with small polyps (< 5 mm). Therefore, for detection of gallbladder polyps, we also accepted an alternative reference standard of follow\u2010up by repeated imaging up to six months (demonstrating that there is no gallbladder polyp or if there was a small gallbladder polyp, the polyp persisted) for people in whom cholecystectomy was not performed due to above mentioned reasons. For differentiating between true and pseudo polyps and dysplastic polyps/carcinomas and adenomas/pseudo polyps, histological confirmation is needed, which can only be done after cholecystectomy."

Low concern: if the reference test includes all participants with the target condition relevant to the review.  High concern: if the reference test does not include all participants with the target condition relevant to the review.  (For presence of gallbladder polyps, this means that there was low concern if patients with small polyps not undergoing cholecystectomy underwent follow\u2010up by repeated imaging. For differentiating polyp types, this means there was low concern if all patients were included in the histopathological analysis).      Domain 4: flow and timing    Flow and timing   Time interval between index test and reference standard (histopathological analysis) was set at 3 months. This is the estimated maximum time on the waiting list for elective cholecystectomy.  Time interval between index test and the alternative reference standard of imaging (in absence of histopathological analysis for determining presence/absence of gallbladder polyps) was set at 6 months.      Was there an appropriate interval between the index test and reference standard?   Yes: if the time interval between index test and reference standard was < 3 months if reference standard was histopathological analysis after cholecystectomy and up to 6 months if the reference standard was a repeated imaging.  No: if the time interval between index test and reference standard was > 3 months if reference standard was histopathological analysis after cholecystectomy and < 6 months if the reference standard was a repeated imaging.  Unclear: if the time interval between index test and reference standard was not clear.     Did all participants receive a reference standard?   Yes: if all participants received a reference standard. No: If some of the participants did not receive a reference standard. We will exclude such studies.  Unclear: If it was not clear whether all participants received a reference standard. We will exclude such studies. Therefore, we anticipated that all studies included in the review would be classified as 'yes' for this item.      Did all participants receive the same reference standard?   Yes: if all the participants received the same reference standard. No: if different participants received different reference standards. Unclear: if this information was not clear.     Were all participants included in the analysis?   Yes: if all the participants were included in the analysis irrespective of whether the results were uninterpretable.  No: if some participants were excluded from the analysis because of uninterpretable results.  Unclear: if this information was not clear.     Could the participant flow have introduced bias?   Low risk of bias: if 'yes' classification for all the above 4 questions. High risk of bias: if 'no' classification for any of the above 4 questions. Unclear risk of bias: if 'unclear' classification for any of the above 4 questions but without a 'no' classification for any of the above 4 questions."
