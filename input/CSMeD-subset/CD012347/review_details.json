    "title": "Psychological therapies for the treatment of depression in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease",
    "abstract": "Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been recognised as a global health concern, and one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Projections of the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate that prevalence rates of COPD continue to increase, and by 2030, it will become the world's third leading cause of death. Depression is a major comorbidity amongst patients with COPD, with an estimate prevalence of up to 80% in severe stages of COPD. Prevalence studies show that patients who have COPD are four times as likely to develop depression compared to those without COPD. Regrettably, they rarely receive appropriate treatment for COPD\u2010related depression. Available findings from trials indicate that untreated depression is associated with worse compliance with medical treatment, poor quality of life, increased mortality rates, increased hospital admissions and readmissions, prolonged length of hospital stay, and subsequently, increased costs to the healthcare system. Given the burden and high prevalence of untreated depression, it is important to evaluate and update existing experimental evidence using rigorous methodology, and to identify effective psychological therapies for patients with COPD\u2010related depression.    Objectives To assess the effectiveness of psychological therapies for the treatment of depression in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2018, Issue 11), and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO from June 2016 to 26 November 2018. Previously these databases were searched via the Cochrane Airways and Common Mental Disorders Groups' Specialised Trials Registers (all years to June 2016). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the ISRCTN registry, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to 26 November 2018 to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. Additionally, the grey literature databases and the reference lists of studies initially identified for full\u2010text screening were also searched.    Selection criteria Eligible for inclusion were randomised controlled trials that compared the use of psychological therapies with either no intervention, education, or combined with a co\u2010intervention and compared with the same co\u2010intervention in a population of patients with COPD whose depressive symptoms were measured before or at baseline assessment.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts identified by the search to determine which studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. We assessed two primary outcomes: depressive symptoms and adverse events; and the following secondary outcomes: quality of life, dyspnoea, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), exercise tolerance, hospital length of stay or readmission rate, and cost\u2010effectiveness. Potentially eligible full\u2010text articles were also independently assessed by two review authors. A PRISMA flow diagram was prepared to demonstrate the decision process in detail. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' evaluation tool to examine the risk of bias, and assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE framework. All outcomes were continuous, therefore, we calculated the pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) or mean difference (MD) with a corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). We used a random\u2010effects model to calculate treatment effects.    Main results The findings are based on 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with a total of 1500 participants. In some of the included studies, the investigators did not recruit participants with clinically confirmed depression but applied screening criteria after randomisation. Hence, across the studies, baseline scores for depressive symptoms varied from no symptoms to severe depression. The severity of COPD across the studies was moderate to severe.  Primary outcomes  There was a small effect showing the effectiveness of psychological therapies in improving depressive symptoms when compared to no intervention (SMD 0.19, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.33; P = 0.009; 6 studies, 764 participants), or to education (SMD 0.23, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.41; P = 0.010; 3 studies, 507 participants).  Two studies compared psychological therapies plus a co\u2010intervention versus the co\u2010intervention alone (i.e. pulmonary rehabilitation (PR)). The results suggest that a psychological therapy combined with a PR programme can reduce depressive symptoms more than a PR programme alone (SMD 0.37, 95% CI \u20100.00 to 0.74; P = 0.05; 2 studies, 112 participants).  We rated the quality of evidence as very low. Owing to the nature of psychological therapies, blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessment was a concern.  None of the included studies measured adverse events. Secondary outcomes  Quality of life was measured in four studies in the comparison with no intervention, and in three studies in the comparison with education. We found inconclusive results for improving quality of life. However, when we pooled data from two studies using the same measure, the result suggested that psychological therapy improved quality of life better than no intervention. One study measured hospital admission rates and cost\u2010effectiveness and showed significant reductions in the intervention group compared to the education group. We rated the quality of evidence as very low for the secondary outcomes.    Authors' conclusions The findings from this review indicate that psychological therapies (using a CBT\u2010based approach) may be effective for treating COPD\u2010related depression, but the evidence is limited. Depressive symptoms improved more in the intervention groups compared to: 1) no intervention (attention placebo or standard care), 2) educational interventions, and 3) a co\u2010intervention (pulmonary rehabilitation). However, the effect sizes were small and quality of the evidence very low due to clinical heterogeneity and risk of bias. This means that more experimental studies with larger numbers of participants are needed, to confirm the potential beneficial effects of therapies with a CBT approach for COPD\u2010related depression.  New trials should also address the gap in knowledge related to limited data on adverse effects, and the secondary outcomes of quality of life, dyspnoea, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), exercise tolerance, hospital length of stay and frequency of readmissions, and cost\u2010effectiveness. Also, new research studies need to adhere to robust methodology to produce higher quality evidence.",

        "Types of studies": "All the studies included in this review are randomised controlled trials (RCTs); with one study being a cluster RCT. We had intended to include cross\u2010over trials if identified by the search; however, we did not find any.",
        "Types of participants": "We included studies involving adults, 40 years of age and older, of either gender, and of any ethnicity. As most people with COPD begin experiencing COPD symptoms in their 40s, it is unlikely that individuals under 40 years of age would be diagnosed with clinically significant COPD (WHO 2018). As per protocol, studies were eligible to be included in this review if the participants were diagnosed with COPD (FEV1/FVC less than 70% predicted) and a recognised depressive disorder (or depressive symptoms) at the time of recruitment to the trial \u2013 assessed using standardised diagnostic criteria, or a formal, validated instrument (i.e. a questionnaire), or both. Considering that trials testing effectiveness of psychological therapies often apply diagnostic criteria for depression after randomisation and at baseline assessment (i.e. participants are not included in the trial on the basis of having a depressive diagnosis or depression symptoms), we allowed inclusion of these studies as well. The COPD diagnosis must have been made by a medical professional, clinically, or by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria, or both (WHO 2018). Depression diagnostic criteria included, but were not limited to, DSM\u20103, DSM\u20104 (APA 2000), DSM\u20105 (APA 2013). As long as a comorbidity was not the primary focus, we included studies with participants with comorbid chronic physical conditions (e.g. hypertension, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, asthma), comorbid mental disorders (e.g. anxiety), or both. For example, we did not include interventions where anxiety was the primary focus. All types of settings were eligible for inclusion, e.g. inpatient (psychiatric setting, inpatient treatment for COPD), outpatient, and primary care. As per protocol, studies containing subsets of eligible participants were permitted, providing 60% of the study population had clinically diagnosed COPD and a depressive disorder. However, participants with clinically diagnosed COPD and a depressive disorder were the primary population in all of the studies included in this review.",

        "Types of interventions": "Although gradually increasing, there is a limited number of experimental trials evaluating the effectiveness of psychological therapies as a treatment for depression in patients with COPD. Therefore, we included studies that assessed any form of psychological therapies for the treatment of COPD\u2010related depression. We prespecified three comparators, listed below. Studies in which a psychological therapy was delivered in combination with another intervention (co\u2010intervention) were included only if there was a comparison group that received the same co\u2010intervention alone. We included any mode of delivery, e.g. group or one\u2010on\u2010one sessions, phone, e\u2010mail, or internet\u2010based. Listed below are psychological therapies that were eligible for inclusion in our review, and the examples of relevant therapeutic approaches, which fall into five broad categories (Kazdin 2000). behaviour therapies (e.g. behavioural activation, relaxation training)   cognitive and cognitive behavioural therapies (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy, rational emotive therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, mindfulness\u2010based cognitive therapy)    psychoanalysis and psychodynamic therapies (e.g. functional analytic psychotherapy, insight\u2010oriented therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, group therapy)    humanistic therapy (e.g. Gestalt therapy, person\u2010centred therapy)   integrative or holistic therapy (relaxation, hypnotherapy, imagery) behaviour therapies (e.g. behavioural activation, relaxation training) cognitive and cognitive behavioural therapies (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy, rational emotive therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, mindfulness\u2010based cognitive therapy) psychoanalysis and psychodynamic therapies (e.g. functional analytic psychotherapy, insight\u2010oriented therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, group therapy) humanistic therapy (e.g. Gestalt therapy, person\u2010centred therapy) integrative or holistic therapy (relaxation, hypnotherapy, imagery) Other approaches included, for example, expressive therapy, family therapy, narrative therapy. no intervention (i.e. attention placebo, psychological placebo, waiting list, and usual care)    education only (written or oral; i.e. information about physical and mental health issues provided during a medical consultation or during a visit with a nurse, where no formal counselling or psychological therapy was provided)    co\u2010intervention (only if the same co\u2010intervention was used in the intervention arm of the study).
