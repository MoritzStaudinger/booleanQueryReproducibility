    "title": "Melatonin for the promotion of sleep in adults in the intensive care unit",
    "abstract": "Background Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) experience sleep deprivation caused by environmental disruption, such as high noise levels and 24\u2010hour lighting, as well as increased patient care activities and invasive monitoring as part of their care. Sleep deprivation affects physical and psychological health, and patients perceive the quality of their sleep to be poor whilst in the ICU. Artificial lighting during night\u2010time hours in the ICU may contribute to reduced production of melatonin in critically ill patients. Melatonin is known to have a direct effect on the circadian rhythm, and it appears to reset a natural rhythm, thus promoting sleep.    Objectives To assess whether the quantity and quality of sleep may be improved by administration of melatonin to adults in the intensive care unit. To assess whether melatonin given for sleep promotion improves both physical and psychological patient outcomes.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to September 2017), Embase (1974 to September 2017), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1937 to September 2017), and PsycINFO (1806 to September 2017). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles.    Selection criteria We included randomized and quasi\u2010randomized controlled trials with adult participants (over the age of 16) admitted to the ICU with any diagnoses given melatonin versus a comparator to promote overnight sleep. We included participants who were mechanically ventilated and those who were not mechanically ventilated. We planned to include studies that compared the use of melatonin, given at an appropriate clinical dose with the intention of promoting night\u2010time sleep, against no agent; or against another agent administered specifically to promote sleep.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and synthesized findings. We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE.    Main results We included four studies with 151 randomized participants. Two studies included participants who were mechanically ventilated, one study included a mix of ventilated and non\u2010ventilated participants and in one study participants were being weaned from mechanical ventilation. Three studies reported admission diagnoses, which varied: these included sepsis, pneumonia and cardiac or cardiorespiratory arrest. All studies compared melatonin against no agent; three were placebo\u2010controlled trials; and one compared melatonin with usual care. All studies administered melatonin in the evening.  All studies reported adequate methods for randomization and placebo\u2010controlled trials were blinded at the participant and personnel level. We noted high risk of attrition bias in one study and were unclear about potential bias introduced in two studies with differences between participants at baseline.  It was not appropriate to combine data owing to differences in measurement tools, or methods used to report data.  The effects of melatonin on subjectively rated quantity and quality of sleep are uncertain (very low certainty evidence). Three studies (139 participants) reported quantity and quality of sleep as measured through reports of participants or family members or by personnel assessments. Study authors in one study reported no difference in sleep efficiency index scores between groups for participant assessment (using Richards\u2010Campbell Sleep Questionnaire) and nurse assessment. Two studies reported no difference in duration of sleep observed by nurses.  The effects of melatonin on objectively measured quantity and quality of sleep are uncertain (very low certainty evidence). Two studies (37 participants) reported quantity and quality of sleep as measured by polysomnography (PSG), actigraphy, bispectral index (BIS) or electroencephalogram (EEG). Study authors in one study reported no difference in sleep efficiency index scores between groups using BIS and actigraphy. These authors also reported longer sleep in participants given melatonin which was not statistically significant, and improved sleep (described as \"better sleep\") in participants given melatonin from analysis of area under the curve (AUC) of BIS data. One study used PSG but authors were unable to report data because of a large loss of participant data.  One study (82 participants) reported no evidence of a difference in anxiety scores (very low certainty evidence). Two studies (94 participants) reported data for mortality: one study reported that overall one\u2010third of participants died; and one study reported no evidence of difference between groups in hospital mortality (very low certainty). One study (82 participants) reported no evidence of a difference in length of ICU stay (very low certainty evidence). Effects of melatonin on adverse events were reported in two studies (107 participants), and are uncertain (very low certainty evidence): one study reported headache in one participant given melatonin, and one study reported excessive sleepiness in one participant given melatonin and two events in the control group (skin reaction in one participant, and excessive sleepiness in another participant).  The certainty of the evidence for each outcome was limited by sparse data with few participants. We noted study limitations in some studies due to high attrition and differences between groups in baseline data; and doses of melatonin varied between studies. Methods used to measure data were not consistent for outcomes, and use of some measurement tools may not be effective for use on the ICU patient. All studies included participants in the ICU but we noted differences in ICU protocols, and one included study used a non\u2010standard sedation protocol with participants which introduced indirectness to the evidence.    Authors' conclusions We found insufficient evidence to determine whether administration of melatonin would improve the quality and quantity of sleep in ICU patients. We identified sparse data, and noted differences in study methodology, in ICU sedation protocols, and in methods used to measure and report sleep. We identified five ongoing studies from database and clinical trial register searches. Inclusion of data from these studies in future review updates would provide more certainty for the review outcomes.",

        "Types of outcome measures": "We were interested in quantity and quality of sleep. The experience of sleep may not always be representative of objectively measured sleep, and given that patients perceive that they have disrupted sleep while in the ICU (Freedman 1999), we included this outcome, regardless of whether validated scales had been used for measurement. An added issue for this outcome is that critically ill patients may have limited or no ability to communicate. Therefore, we were equally interested in the perceptions of carers and family members who may have an impression of sleep from the bedside, and in subjective measures used by personnel to assess sleep. We included assessments of sleep that have been performed at the end of follow\u2010up, as defined by study authors, for example in the morning or during the daytime that followed administration of the intervention. We included assessments that were completed with the use of scales, whether validated or not, and modified for each user, such as the Richards\u2010Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (Richards 2000), or through compilation of sleep diaries, such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Diary (Monk 1994). Study authors may use scales to determine levels of participant consciousness and we aimed to report study authors' interpretations of these scales. For example, participants may be sedated at level 3 on the Ramsay Sedation Scale (\u201cPatient responds to commands only\u201d) and may be in a sleep\u2010like state at level 4 or 5 on this scale (\u201cPatient exhibits brisk response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus\u201d or \u201cPatient exhibits a sluggish response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus\u201d) (Ramsay Sedation Scale). We reported the quantity and quality of sleep as measured by objective equipment. In particular, polysomnography (PSG) is considered the most accurate and objective tool that can be used to measure sleep and to identify sleep disorders (Beecroft 2008). PSG measurements can be analysed to detect sleep onset, sleep efficiency, and length of sleep stages, as well as irregularities, such as apnoea and interrupted sleep. We also accepted measurements obtained when other tools had been used to record sleep activity (Beecroft 2008; Benini 2005; Elliott 2013): \u2018actigraphy\u2019 is a wristband\u2010style tool that measures gross motor activity and is analysed to score total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and awakenings; bispectral index (BIS) is typically used to calculate depth of anaesthesia through interpretation of an electroencephalogram (EEG) reading; and measures of EEG alone can be used to interpret electrical brain activity as sleep time. We acknowledge that collection and interpretation of data using objective tools may be problematic in people who are critically ill because manual methods have poor inter\u2010rater reliability (Ambrogio 2008); people who are critically ill may have various forms of encephalopathy (septic, toxic, or metabolic) or may be treated with intravenous sedatives and these factors may make interpretation of EEG readings more problematic. We used interpretations of these measurements as reported by each study author to define the quantity and quality of sleep. Our aim was to establish not only whether melatonin improves sleep but whether improvement in sleep leads to better patient outcomes. This was reflected in our secondary outcome measure, which considered potential physical and psychological consequences of sleep loss, although we acknowledge that it may not be possible to ascertain whether a reduction in such events is directly attributable to improved sleep. We assessed physical consequences of sleep loss by collecting data from studies that reported the number of participants who had had an adverse event during follow\u2010up time, as defined by study authors. We assessed psychological consequences of sleep loss by collecting data from studies that reported the number of participants who had been given a diagnosis of anxiety or depression, or both, by using validated assessment tools during the follow\u2010up period, as defined by study authors.
