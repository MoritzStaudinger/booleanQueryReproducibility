    "title": "Interventions using social networking sites to promote contraception in women of reproductive age",
    "abstract": "Background Social networking sites (SNSs) have great potential as a platform for public health interventions to address the unmet need for contraception.    Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions using SNSs to promote the uptake of and adherence to contraception in reproductive\u2010age women.    Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and six other databases on January 2018. We also searched Google Scholar, key conference proceedings, checked the reference lists of included studies, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.    Selection criteria We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non\u2010randomised interventional studies (NRS) in women of reproductive age. SNSs requiring a social profile within a bounded or restricted\u2010access system of shared connections were included. We also included trials that utilised SNSs only or as an adjunct to an intervention. Studies had to have a follow\u2010up outcome assessment of at least three months.    Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full\u2010text studies, and extracted data from included studies. A third author was assigned to arbitrate areas of disagreement. Authors assessed risk of bias according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We were unable to conduct a meta\u2010analysis due to the heterogeneity of the study designs and outcome measures.    Main results Of the 461 unique records found, only two studies met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were conducted in the USA and were at high risk of bias. One RCT included 2284 women exposed to a web\u2010based SNS or nothing. The groups were no different post intervention in their self\u2010reported consistency of contraceptive use or knowledge of the relative effectiveness of different methods. There was a small but significant increase in the use of more effective methods (long\u2010acting reversible methods) at 12 months' follow\u2010up.  The second study, a cluster RCT with 1578 women, used a closed Facebook page showing sexual health content compared to a modified Facebook news page that avoided sexual health content. They found no differences in the use of condoms at last act of sexual intercourse at six months or the intention to use condoms between the intervention and control groups.    Authors' conclusions Despite the prevalence of SNSs, we found little scientific evidence to support the use of SNSs to improve contraceptive use or adherence among women.",

        "Types of studies": "We considered interventional studies including randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non\u2010randomised interventional studies (NRS) to include non\u2010RCTs. We expected limited evidence from RCTs that utilised an SNS as an intervention. Thus, we included NRS to examine the evidence base broadly.",
        "Types of participants": "Women of reproductive age who may have initiated contraceptive use, switched to a different method or continued to use the same method. Reproductive age was defined as between 15 and 49 years of age as per the World Health Organization (WHO) definition (WHO 2006). In studies that included both sexes, we requested results pertaining to women from the authors. Postpartum or postabortal women were also included.",
        "Types of interventions": "We included studies where the intervention was delivered either solely via a named SNS, or in conjunction with another method. We included interventions if the purpose was to improve uptake and adherence, or both uptake and adherence to contraception compared to standard delivery of care or another intervention. The included interventions fulfilled one of the following aims: improved uptake of contraception;   promoted use of a specific contraceptive method;   promoted uptake of more effective contraceptive methods;   improved adherence to contraception; and   both improved uptake and adherence to contraception. improved uptake of contraception; promoted use of a specific contraceptive method; promoted uptake of more effective contraceptive methods; improved adherence to contraception; and both improved uptake and adherence to contraception. Interventions were included if they targeted current and potential contraception users. The authors definition of more effective contraceptive methods was accepted, although this was likely to include long\u2010acting reversible contraceptive methods. The interventions had to be delivered through named SNSs where the participant had a personal account that allowed them to access the intervention. Although not an exclusion criteria, SNSs were expected to allow participants to interact with each other. We excluded any intervention delivered by an application or website where a personal account was not required, where the intervention could only be utilised when downloaded, or if participants could not interact with the intervention directly. We included SNSs available in a downloadable form only if they also had an open\u2010access website.",
        "Types of outcome measures": "Contraception use (for at least three months postintervention), which included:   initiation of a new method;   increased uptake of more effective methods;   improved adherence to a method; and   both increased uptake and improved adherence. Contraception use (for at least three months postintervention), which included: initiation of a new method; increased uptake of more effective methods; improved adherence to a method; and both increased uptake and improved adherence. Contraception use was be assessed in various ways, and we accepted the method used by the trial investigator. The time frame for assessment was three months or more for the initiation of a new method and improved adherence of an existing method as defined by the study. Change in attitude or knowledge about contraception.   Attitudes towards the use of SNSs as an intervention. Change in attitude or knowledge about contraception.
