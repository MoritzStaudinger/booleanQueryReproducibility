    "abstract": "Background Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) and Xpert MTB/RIF are World Health Organization (WHO)\u2010recommended rapid nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) widely used for simultaneous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and rifampicin resistance in sputum. To extend our previous review on extrapulmonary tuberculosis (Kohli 2018), we performed this update to inform updated WHO policy (WHO Consolidated Guidelines (Module 3) 2020).    Objectives To estimate diagnostic accuracy of Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults with presumptive extrapulmonary tuberculosis.    Search methods Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, Web of Science, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry, and ProQuest, 2 August 2019 and 28 January 2020 (Xpert Ultra studies), without language restriction.    Selection criteria Cross\u2010sectional and cohort studies using non\u2010respiratory specimens. Forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis: tuberculous meningitis and pleural, lymph node, bone or joint, genitourinary, peritoneal, pericardial, disseminated tuberculosis. Reference standards were culture and a study\u2010defined composite reference standard (tuberculosis detection); phenotypic drug susceptibility testing and line probe assays (rifampicin resistance detection).    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias and applicability using QUADAS\u20102. For tuberculosis detection, we performed separate analyses by specimen type and reference standard using the bivariate model to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). We applied a latent class meta\u2010analysis model to three forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. We assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE.    Main results 69 studies: 67 evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF and 11 evaluated Xpert Ultra, of which nine evaluated both tests. Most studies were conducted in China, India, South Africa, and Uganda. Overall, risk of bias was low for patient selection, index test, and flow and timing domains, and low (49%) or unclear (43%) for the reference standard domain. Applicability for the patient selection domain was unclear for most studies because we were unsure of the clinical settings.  Cerebrospinal fluid  Xpert Ultra (6 studies)  Xpert Ultra pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% CrI) against culture were 89.4% (79.1 to 95.6) (89 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) and 91.2% (83.2 to 95.7) (386 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have tuberculous meningitis, 168 would be Xpert Ultra\u2010positive: of these, 79 (47%) would not have tuberculosis (false\u2010positives) and 832 would be Xpert Ultra\u2010negative: of these, 11 (1%) would have tuberculosis (false\u2010negatives).  Xpert MTB/RIF (30 studies)  Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity against culture were 71.1% (62.8 to 79.1) (571 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and 96.9% (95.4 to 98.0) (2824 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have tuberculous meningitis, 99 would be Xpert MTB/RIF\u2010positive: of these, 28 (28%) would not have tuberculosis; and 901 would be Xpert MTB/RIF\u2010negative: of these, 29 (3%) would have tuberculosis.  Pleural fluid  Xpert Ultra (4 studies)  Xpert Ultra pooled sensitivity and specificity against culture were 75.0% (58.0 to 86.4) (158 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and 87.0% (63.1 to 97.9) (240 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have pleural tuberculosis, 192 would be Xpert Ultra\u2010positive: of these, 117 (61%) would not have tuberculosis; and 808 would be Xpert Ultra\u2010negative: of these, 25 (3%) would have tuberculosis.  Xpert MTB/RIF (25 studies)  Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity against culture were 49.5% (39.8 to 59.9) (644 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) and 98.9% (97.6 to 99.7) (2421 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have pleural tuberculosis, 60 would be Xpert MTB/RIF\u2010positive: of these, 10 (17%) would not have tuberculosis; and 940 would be Xpert MTB/RIF\u2010negative: of these, 50 (5%) would have tuberculosis.  Lymph node aspirate  Xpert Ultra (1 study)  Xpert Ultra sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval) against composite reference standard were 70% (51 to 85) (30 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and 100% (92 to 100) (43 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have lymph node tuberculosis, 70 would be Xpert Ultra\u2010positive and 0 (0%) would not have tuberculosis; 930 would be Xpert Ultra\u2010negative and 30 (3%) would have tuberculosis.  Xpert MTB/RIF (4 studies)  Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity against composite reference standard were 81.6% (61.9 to 93.3) (377 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) and 96.4% (91.3 to 98.6) (302 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have lymph node tuberculosis, 118 would be Xpert MTB/RIF\u2010positive and 37 (31%) would not have tuberculosis; 882 would be Xpert MTB/RIF\u2010negative and 19 (2%) would have tuberculosis.  In lymph node aspirate, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled specificity against culture was 86.2% (78.0 to 92.3), lower than that against a composite reference standard. Using the latent class model, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled specificity was 99.5% (99.1 to 99.7), similar to that observed with a composite reference standard.  Rifampicin resistance  Xpert Ultra (4 studies)  Xpert Ultra pooled sensitivity and specificity were 100.0% (95.1 to 100.0), (24 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) and 100.0% (99.0 to 100.0) (105 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have rifampicin resistance, 100 would be Xpert Ultra\u2010positive (resistant): of these, zero (0%) would not have rifampicin resistance; and 900 would be Xpert Ultra\u2010negative (susceptible): of these, zero (0%) would have rifampicin resistance.  Xpert MTB/RIF (19 studies)  Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity were 96.5% (91.9 to 98.8) (148 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence) and 99.1% (98.0 to 99.7) (822 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have rifampicin resistance, 105 would be Xpert MTB/RIF\u2010positive (resistant): of these, 8 (8%) would not have rifampicin resistance; and 895 would be Xpert MTB/RIF\u2010negative (susceptible): of these, 3 (0.3%) would have rifampicin resistance.    Authors' conclusions Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF may be helpful in diagnosing extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Sensitivity varies across different extrapulmonary specimens: while for most specimens specificity is high, the tests rarely yield a positive result for people without tuberculosis. For tuberculous meningitis, Xpert Ultra had higher sensitivity and lower specificity than Xpert MTB/RIF against culture. Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF had similar sensitivity and specificity for rifampicin resistance. Future research should acknowledge the concern associated with culture as a reference standard in paucibacillary specimens and consider ways to address this limitation.",

        "Types of studies": "We included cross\u2010sectional and cohort studies. In addition, we had planned to include randomized controlled trials that evaluated the use of the index(s) test on patient health outcomes, but that also reported sensitivity and specificity. Although the study design was a randomized trial for the purpose of determining the impact of the test on participant outcomes, the study design was a cross\u2010sectional study for the purpose of determining the diagnostic accuracy of the index tests in this review. However, we did not identify any randomized controlled trials. We used abstracts to identify published studies and included these when they met the inclusion criteria. We only included studies that reported data comparing the index test(s) to an acceptable reference standard from which we could extract true\u2010positive (TP), true\u2010negative (TN), false\u2010positive (FP), and false\u2010negative (FN) values. We excluded case\u2010control studies and case reports.",
        "Participants": "We included studies where at least 85% of the participants enrolled were adults aged 15 years or older with presumptive extrapulmonary tuberculosis from all settings and countries. Restricting the age group to adults differs from the original review, where we also included children (Kohli 2018). We did this because children are now included in a separate Cochrane Review (Kay 2020). We excluded studies where we could not disaggregate data on adults from those in children and studies where we could not tell the age of the participants enrolled. We included non\u2010respiratory specimens (such as CSF, pleural fluid, lymph node aspirate or tissue). We excluded sputum and other respiratory specimens, such as fluid obtained from bronchial alveolar lavage and tracheal aspiration. As we anticipated finding many studies, we set a bar to exclude smaller studies to reduce unnecessary work. We therefore required studies to provide data for at least five specimens for a given form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis included in the review. We excluded studies evaluating the use of Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF to diagnose relapse of previously\u2010treated extrapulmonary tuberculosis, so as to avoid the selection bias that may arise by limiting to a group that is already at elevated risk of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. We attempted to identify studies that included participants who were not taking anti\u2010tuberculosis drugs or had taken anti\u2010tuberculosis drugs for less than seven days.",
        "Index tests": "The index tests were Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF. Index test results are automatically generated (i.e. there is a single threshold), and the user is provided with a printable test result as follows. Xpert Ultra MTB (M tuberculosis) DETECTED HIGH; RIF (rifampicin) Resistance DETECTED   MTB DETECTED MEDIUM; RIF Resistance DETECTED   MTB DETECTED LOW; RIF Resistance DETECTED   MTB DETECTED VERY LOW; RIF Resistance DETECTED   MTB DETECTED HIGH; RIF Resistance NOT DETECTED   MTB DETECTED MEDIUM; RIF Resistance NOT DETECTED   MTB DETECTED LOW; RIF Resistance NOT DETECTED   MTB DETECTED VERY LOW; RIF Resistance NOT DETECTED   MTB DETECTED HIGH; RIF Resistance INDETERMINATE   MTB DETECTED MEDIUM; RIF Resistance INDETERMINATE   MTB DETECTED LOW; RIF Resistance INDETERMINATE   MTB DETECTED VERY LOW; RIF Resistance INDETERMINATE   MTB Trace DETECTED; RIF Resistance INDETERMINATE   INVALID (the presence or absence of MTB cannot be determined)   ERROR (the presence or absence of MTB cannot be determined)   NO RESULT (the presence or absence of MTB cannot be determined) MTB (M tuberculosis) DETECTED HIGH; RIF (rifampicin) Resistance DETECTED MTB DETECTED MEDIUM; RIF Resistance DETECTED MTB DETECTED LOW; RIF Resistance DETECTED MTB DETECTED VERY LOW; RIF Resistance DETECTED MTB DETECTED HIGH; RIF Resistance NOT DETECTED MTB DETECTED MEDIUM; RIF Resistance NOT DETECTED MTB DETECTED LOW; RIF Resistance NOT DETECTED MTB DETECTED VERY LOW; RIF Resistance NOT DETECTED MTB DETECTED HIGH; RIF Resistance INDETERMINATE MTB DETECTED MEDIUM; RIF Resistance INDETERMINATE MTB DETECTED LOW; RIF Resistance INDETERMINATE MTB DETECTED VERY LOW; RIF Resistance INDETERMINATE MTB Trace DETECTED; RIF Resistance INDETERMINATE INVALID (the presence or absence of MTB cannot be determined) ERROR (the presence or absence of MTB cannot be determined) NO RESULT (the presence or absence of MTB cannot be determined) Xpert Ultra incorporates a semi\u2010quantitative classification for results: trace, very low, low, moderate, and high. \u2018Trace' corresponds to the lowest bacterial burden for detection of M tuberculosis (Chakravorty 2017). We considered a trace result to mean MTB (M tuberculosis) DETECTED. However, no rifampicin\u2010resistance result was available for participants with trace results because the trace sample is always reported as 'INDETERMINATE' for rifampin resistance (Cepheid 2018). Xpert MTB/RIF MTB (M tuberculosis) DETECTED; Rif (rifampicin) resistance DETECTED    MTB DETECTED; Rif resistance NOT DETECTED   MTB detected; Rif resistance INDETERMINATE   MTB NOT DETECTED   INVALID (the presence or absence of MTB cannot be determined)   ERROR (the presence or absence of MTB cannot be determined)   NO RESULT (the presence or absence of MTB cannot be determined) MTB (M tuberculosis) DETECTED; Rif (rifampicin) resistance DETECTED MTB DETECTED; Rif resistance NOT DETECTED MTB detected; Rif resistance INDETERMINATE MTB NOT DETECTED INVALID (the presence or absence of MTB cannot be determined) ERROR (the presence or absence of MTB cannot be determined) NO RESULT (the presence or absence of MTB cannot be determined)",
        "Target conditions": "The target conditions were extrapulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. We included eight common forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis and considered subcategories of the target condition as separate diagnostic classifications (CDC 2018; Sandgren 2013; Sharma 2004). Tuberculous meningitis.   Pleural tuberculosis.   Lymph node tuberculosis.   Genitourinary tuberculosis.   Bone or joint tuberculosis.   Peritoneal tuberculosis.   Pericardial tuberculosis.   Disseminated tuberculosis. Tuberculous meningitis. Pleural tuberculosis. Lymph node tuberculosis. Genitourinary tuberculosis. Bone or joint tuberculosis. Peritoneal tuberculosis. Pericardial tuberculosis. Disseminated tuberculosis. Table 1 lists the forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis and specimens used for diagnosis in the review. We excluded less common forms, such as cutaneous tuberculosis, ocular tuberculosis, female genital tuberculosis, and tuberculosis of the breast, ear, and paranasal sinuses (Sharma 2004).",
        "Reference standards": "We included two reference standards. Solid or liquid mycobacterial culture.   \u2018Tuberculosis' was defined as a positive M tuberculosis culture    \u2018Not tuberculosis' was defined as a negative M tuberculosis culture      Composite reference standard.   'Tuberculosis' was defined as a positive M tuberculosis culture or positive composite reference test.    \u2018Not tuberculosis' was defined as a negative M tuberculosis culture and a negative composite reference test. Solid or liquid mycobacterial culture. \u2018Tuberculosis' was defined as a positive M tuberculosis culture \u2018Not tuberculosis' was defined as a negative M tuberculosis culture Composite reference standard. 'Tuberculosis' was defined as a positive M tuberculosis culture or positive composite reference test. \u2018Not tuberculosis' was defined as a negative M tuberculosis culture and a negative composite reference test. The composite reference standard might be based on the results of microbiological tests, culture or NAAT other than Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF; imaging studies; histology; and clinical characteristics, and include at least one component test that is positive, according to the definition of the primary study authors. For pleural tuberculosis, we defined the composite reference standard as the presence of granulomatous inflammation or a positive culture. We proposed this definition because we found evidence to support including histopathological examination in the definition. Around 60% of patients undergoing pleural biopsy will show granulomatous inflammation (American Thoracic Society 2000). In a prospective cohort study of participants with clinical and radiological findings consistent with pleural tuberculosis, Conde 2003 found that histological examination of tissue obtained from pleural biopsy had a higher diagnostic yield (78%; 66/84) than that of culture (62%; 52/84). Culture is considered the best reference standard for tuberculosis. However, culture may lead to misclassification of some cases of extrapulmonary tuberculosis as \u2018not tuberculosis', owing to the paucibacillary nature of the disease. This means that culture may have low sensitivity for extrapulmonary tuberculosis overall and further that culture sensitivity may differ for different forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (Lewinsohn 2017). This misclassification by culture may lead to biased estimates (overestimation or underestimation) of the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF. The extent of bias will depend on the frequency of errors by culture and the degree of correlation in errors by culture and the Xpert assays because culture and Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF are likely to pick up cases with a higher bacterial load, and are likely to miss cases with a lower bacterial load. Ignoring this dependence could lead to an overestimation of the sensitivity of Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF. Effect of low sensitivity of culture on Xpert sensitivity: the low sensitivity of culture means that index test FNs may be misclassified as TNs when culture is used as the reference standard. Therefore, when Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF is evaluated against culture, the number of FNs (classified as negative by the index test and positive by the reference test) may be decreased and the sensitivity of the index test may be overestimated.    Effect of low sensitivity of culture on Xpert specificity: the low sensitivity of culture means that index test TPs may be misclassified as FPs when culture is used as the reference standard. Therefore, when Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF is evaluated against culture, the number of FPs (classified as positive by the index test and negative by the reference test) may be increased and specificity of the index test may be underestimated. Effect of low sensitivity of culture on Xpert sensitivity: the low sensitivity of culture means that index test FNs may be misclassified as TNs when culture is used as the reference standard. Therefore, when Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF is evaluated against culture, the number of FNs (classified as negative by the index test and positive by the reference test) may be decreased and the sensitivity of the index test may be overestimated. Effect of low sensitivity of culture on Xpert specificity: the low sensitivity of culture means that index test TPs may be misclassified as FPs when culture is used as the reference standard. Therefore, when Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF is evaluated against culture, the number of FPs (classified as positive by the index test and negative by the reference test) may be increased and specificity of the index test may be underestimated. In contrast to culture, a composite reference standard that includes culture, other tests, and clinical characteristics may correctly classify index test results as TPs (instead of as FPs with respect to culture), especially in people with paucibacillary disease in whom culture may be negative. However, because of the uncertainties that surround a clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis and, in some instances, the conditional dependence of the index tests and other tests in the composite reference standard (for example, for most of these tests, detection of tuberculosis depends on bacillary load), a reference standard that uses additional tests and clinical characteristics (in culture\u2010negative people) may incorrectly classify people without tuberculosis as having tuberculosis (Naaktgeboren 2013). An additional challenge with including a composite reference standard is that the definition of the composite reference standard may vary across studies, making it difficult to interpret the accuracy estimates. Thus both reference standards, culture and composite, are imperfect and may affect accuracy estimates. In an attempt to improve the estimation of diagnostic accuracy, we applied a latent class meta\u2010analysis model to the three most commonly studied forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. This approach provides the sensitivity and specificity of culture in addition to the accuracy of the index tests, thus adjusting for imperfect culture accuracy. The reference standard was culture\u2010based DST using solid or liquid media or line\u2010probe assays, as recommended by the WHO (WHO 2012; WHO Consolidated Guidelines (Module 3) 2020).",

        "Appendix 3. Rules for QUADAS\u20102": "Domain 1: patient selection  Risk of bias: could the selection of patients have introduced bias?  Signalling question 1: was a consecutive or random sample of patients enrolled? We scored \"yes\" if the study enrolled a consecutive or random sample of eligible patients, \"no\" if the study selected patients by convenience, and \"unclear\" if the study did not report the manner of patient selection or we could not tell.    Signalling question 2: was a case\u2010control design avoided? We did not include in the review studies using a case\u2010control design because this study design, especially when used to compare results in severely ill patients versus those in relatively healthy individuals, may lead to overestimation of accuracy in diagnostic studies. We scored \"yes\" for all studies.    Signalling question 3: did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions? We scored \"yes\" if the study included both smear\u2010positive and smear\u2010negative specimens or included only smear\u2010negative specimens. We judged \"no\" if the study included only smear\u2010positive specimens or excluded specimens based on physical appearance (such as purulence) or a biochemical analysis (e.g. adenosine deaminase (ADA), cytology (cell analysis)). We scored \"unclear\" if we could not tell.     Applicability: are there concerns that the included patients and setting do not match the review question?  We were interested in how the index tests performed in patients presumed to have extrapulmonary tuberculosis who were evaluated as they would be in routine practice. We scored \"low concern\" if patients were evaluated at local hospitals or primary care centres. We scored \"high concern\" if patients were evaluated exclusively as inpatients at tertiary care centres, except for tuberculous meningitis (we judged low concern) where we would expect patients to be evaluated in tertiary care settings. We scored \"unclear concern\" if the clinical setting was not reported or if information was insufficient to allow a decision. We also scored \"unclear concern\u201d if Xpert testing was done at a reference laboratory and the clinical setting was not reported for the following reason. It was difficult to tell if a given reference laboratory provided services mainly to very sick patients (inpatients in tertiary care) or to all patients, including very sick patients and those with less severe disease (primary, secondary, and tertiary care).     Domain 2: index test  Risk of bias: could the conduct or interpretation of the index test have introduced bias?   Signalling question 1: were the index test results interpreted without knowledge of results of the reference standard?  We answered this question \"yes\" for all studies because Xpert test results are automatically generated and the user is provided with printable test results. Thus, there is no room for subjective interpretation of test results.  Signalling question 2: If a threshold was used, was it pre\u2010specified? As the threshold is pre\u2010specified in all versions of Xpert, we answered this question \"yes\" for all studies.  Applicability: are there concerns that the index test, its conduct, or its interpretation differ from the review question?  We note that variations in execution of the test might affect accuracy estimates. We judged \"low concern\" if the test was performed according to WHO standard operating procedures (WHO 2014), or if the index test was performed as recommended by the manufacturer for sputum. We scored \"high concern\" if the test was performed in a way that deviated from these recommendations. We scored \"unclear concern\" if we could not tell. In studies that evaluated several different types of specimens, we used the following rule: if \u2265 75% of the specimen types were processed per WHO standard operating procedure (SOP) or as per the manufacturer's instructions, we judged \"low concern\"; if < 50% of the specimen types were processed per WHO SOP or as per the manufacturer's instructions, we scored \"high concern\"; and if at least 50% to 74% of the specimen types were processed per WHO SOP or as per the manufacturer's instructions, or if we could not tell, we scored \"unclear concern\".      Domain 3: reference standard  Risk of bias: could the reference standard, its conduct, or its interpretation have introduced bias?  We considered this domain separately for the reference standard for detection of extrapulmonary tuberculosis and the reference standard for detection of rifampicin resistance.   Signalling question 1: is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition?  For detection of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, culture is generally considered the best reference standard. However, limitations are associated with culture; bacterial load is usually low in extrapulmonary tuberculosis, leading to a reduction in the sensitivity of culture. Concerning the conduct of the reference standard (preparation of the specimen for culture), N\u2010acetyl\u2010L\u2010cysteine\u2010sodium hydroxide is routinely used to homogenize, decontaminate, and liquefy non\u2010sterile specimens for TB culture (American Thoracic Society 2000). However, CSF, pleural fluid, and lymph node aspirates are usually considered sterile, and standards specify, \"specimens collected from normally sterile sites may be placed directly into the culture medium\u201d (American Thoracic Society 2000). Overly processing (sterile) specimens with N\u2010acetyl\u2010L\u2010cysteine\u2010sodium hydroxide may lead to a decrease in viable TB bacteria and consequently false\u2010negative cultures. We scored \"yes\" if studies did not use N\u2010acetyl\u2010L\u2010cysteine\u2010sodium hydroxide for processing specimens and \"unclear\" if studies used N\u2010acetyl\u2010L\u2010cysteine\u2010sodium hydroxide. We discussed this further under Discussion and Strengths and weaknesses of the review.  For detection of rifampicin resistance, culture\u2010based drug susceptibility testing (DST, also called conventional phenotypic method) is considered to be the best reference standard. Line probe assays are also WHO\u2010recommended tests for rifampicin resistance. As we extracted data only for studies that used culture\u2010based DST or line probe assays (most often MTBDRplus), we answered this question \"yes\" for all studies.    Signalling question 2: were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of results of the index test?  We scored \"yes\" if the reference test provided an automated result (e.g. MGIT 960), if blinding was explicitly stated, or if it was clear that the reference standard was performed at a separate laboratory and/or was performed by different people. We scored \"no\" if the study stated that the reference standard result was interpreted with knowledge of the Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF test result. We scored \"unclear\" if we could not tell.    Signalling question 3: (rifampicin resistance) were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of results of the index test?  We added a signalling question for rifampicin resistance detection. We scored \"yes\" if the reference test provided an automated result (e.g. MGIT 960), if solid culture was performed followed by speciation, if blinding was explicitly stated, or if it was clear that the reference standard was performed at a separate laboratory or was performed by different people, or both. We scored \"no\" if the study stated that the reference standard result was interpreted with knowledge of the Xpert test result. We scored \"unclear\" if we could not tell. Not all studies evaluated detection of rifampicin resistance; therefore this question was not applicable to all studies.     Applicability: are there concerns that the target condition as defined by the reference standard does not match the question?  We judged \"high concern\" if included studies did not speciate mycobacteria isolated in culture, \"low concern\" if speciation was performed, and \"unclear concern\" if we could not tell. If a study performed sequencing, we considered the speciation yes. If the study only used a composite reference standard, we considered applicability unclear.     Domain 4: flow and timing  Risk of bias: could the patient flow have introduced bias?  Signalling question 1: was there an appropriate interval between the index test and the reference standard?  In most included studies, we expected that specimens for index test and verification by culture (or a composite reference standard) would be obtained at the same time, when patients were evaluated for presumptive extrapulmonary tuberculosis. However, even if there were a delay of several days between index test and reference standard, tuberculosis is a chronic disease, and we considered misclassification of disease status to be unlikely, as long as treatment was not initiated in the interim. We judged \"yes\" if the index test and the reference standard were performed at the same time or if the time interval was less than or equal to seven days, \"no\" if the time interval was greater than seven days, and \"unclear\" if we could not tell.    Signalling question 2: did all patients receive the same reference standard? For the diagnosis of any form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis we answered this question \"yes\" if all participants in the study or a subset of participants in the study (for whom we extracted data) received the acceptable reference standard either culture or a composite reference standard. Regarding culture, we acknowledge that it is possible that some specimens could undergo solid culture and others liquid culture as the reference standard. This could potentially result in variations in accuracy, but we think the variation would be minimal.  For rifampicin resistance detection, we answered \"yes\" if all participants received the same reference standard (either culture\u2010based DST or MTBDRplus), \"no\" if not all participants received the same reference standard, and \"unclear\" if we could not tell.    Signalling question 3: were all patients included in the analysis? We determined the answer to this question by comparing the number of patients enrolled with the number of patients included in the 2 \u00d7 2 tables. We answered \"yes\" if the numbers matched and \"no\" if there were patients enrolled in the study who were not included in the analysis. We answered \"unclear\" if we could not tell.  Judgements for overall \u02bdRisk of bias' assessments.    If we answered all signalling questions for a domain \"yes\", then we scored risk of bias as \"low\".    If we answered all or most signalling questions for a domain \"no\", then we scored risk of bias as \"high\".    If we answered only one signalling question for a domain \"no\", we discussed further the \"risk of bias\" judgement.    If we answered all or most signalling questions for a domain \"unclear\", then we scored risk of bias as \"unclear\".    If we answered only one signalling question for a domain \"unclear\", we discussed further the \"risk of bias\" judgement for the doma",

As we extracted data only for studies that used culture\u2010based DST or line probe assays (most often MTBDRplus), we answered this question \"yes\" for all studies.    Signalling question 2: were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of results of the index test?  We scored \"yes\" if the reference test provided an automated result (e.g. MGIT 960), if blinding was explicitly stated, or if it was clear that the reference standard was performed at a separate laboratory and/or was performed by different people. We scored \"no\" if the study stated that the reference standard result was interpreted with knowledge of the Xpert Ultra or Xpert MTB/RIF test result. We scored \"unclear\" if we could not tell.    Signalling question 3: (rifampicin resistance) were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of results of the index test?  We added a signalling question for rifampicin resistance detection. We scored \"yes\" if the reference test provided an automated result (e.g. MGIT 960), if solid culture was performed followed by speciation, if blinding was explicitly stated, or if it was clear that the reference standard was performed at a separate laboratory or was performed by different people, or both. We scored \"no\" if the study stated that the reference standard result was interpreted with knowledge of the Xpert test result. We scored \"unclear\" if we could not tell. Not all studies evaluated detection of rifampicin resistance; therefore this question was not applicable to all studies.     Applicability: are there concerns that the target condition as defined by the reference standard does not match the question?  We judged \"high concern\" if included studies did not speciate mycobacteria isolated in culture, \"low concern\" if speciation was performed, and \"unclear concern\" if we could not tell. If a study performed sequencing, we considered the speciation yes. If the study only used a composite reference standard, we considered applicability unclear.",
        "Risk of bias: could the reference standard, its conduct, or its interpretation have introduced bias?": "We considered this domain separately for the reference standard for detection of extrapulmonary tuberculosis and the reference standard for detection of rifampicin resistance.   Signalling question 1: is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition?  For detection of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, culture is generally considered the best reference standard. However, limitations are associated with culture; bacterial load is usually low in extrapulmonary tuberculosis, leading to a reduction in the sensitivity of culture. Concerning the conduct of the reference standard (preparation of the specimen for culture), N\u2010acetyl\u2010L\u2010cysteine\u2010sodium hydroxide is routinely used to homogenize, decontaminate, and liquefy non\u2010sterile specimens for TB culture (American Thoracic Society 2000). However, CSF, pleural fluid, and lymph node aspirates are usually considered sterile, and standards specify, \"specimens collected from normally sterile sites may be placed directly into the culture medium\u201d (American Thoracic Society 2000).

In most included studies, we expected that specimens for index test and verification by culture (or a composite reference standard) would be obtained at the same time, when patients were evaluated for presumptive extrapulmonary tuberculosis. However, even if there were a delay of several days between index test and reference standard, tuberculosis is a chronic disease, and we considered misclassification of disease status to be unlikely, as long as treatment was not initiated in the interim.
