    "title": "Once daily long\u2010acting beta2\u2010agonists and long\u2010acting muscarinic antagonists in a combined inhaler versus placebo for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease",
    "abstract": "Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition causing accumulation of mucus in the airways, cough, and breathlessness; the disease is progressive and is the fourth most common cause of death worldwide. Current treatment strategies for COPD are multi\u2010modal and aim to reduce morbidity and mortality and increase patients' quality of life by slowing disease progression and preventing exacerbations. Fixed\u2010dose combinations (FDCs) of a long\u2010acting beta2\u2010agonist (LABA) plus a long\u2010acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) delivered via a single inhaler are approved by regulatory authorities in the USA, Europe, and Japan for the treatment of COPD. Several LABA/LAMA FDCs are available and recent meta\u2010analyses have clarified their utility versus their mono\u2010components in COPD. Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of once\u2010daily LABA/LAMA FDCs versus placebo will facilitate the comparison of different FDCs in future network meta\u2010analyses.    Objectives We assessed the evidence for once\u2010daily LABA/LAMA combinations (delivered in a single inhaler) versus placebo on clinically meaningful outcomes in patients with stable COPD.    Search methods We identified trials from Cochrane Airways' Specialised Register (CASR) and also conducted a search of the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch). We searched CASR and trial registries from their inception to 3 December 2018; we imposed no restriction on language of publication.    Selection criteria We included parallel\u2010group and cross\u2010over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing once\u2010daily LABA/LAMA FDC versus placebo. We included studies reported as full\u2010text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data. We excluded very short\u2010term trials with a duration of less than 3 weeks. We included adults (\u2265 40 years old) with a diagnosis of stable COPD. We included studies that allowed participants to continue using their ICS during the trial as long as the ICS was not part of the randomised treatment.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the search results to determine included studies, extracted data on prespecified outcomes of interest, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies; we resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Where possible, we used a random\u2010effects model to meta\u2010analyse extracted data. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in 'Summary of findings\u2019 tables.    Main results We identified and included 22 RCTs randomly assigning 8641 people with COPD to either once\u2010daily LABA/LAMA FDC (6252 participants) or placebo (3819 participants); nine studies had a cross\u2010over design. Studies had a duration of between three and 52 weeks (median 12 weeks). The mean age of participants across the included studies ranged from 59 to 65 years and in 21 of 22 studies, participants had GOLD stage II or III COPD. Concomitant inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use was permitted in all of the included studies (where stated); across the included studies, between 28% to 58% of participants were using ICS at baseline. Six studies evaluated the once\u2010daily combination of IND/GLY (110/50 \u03bcg), seven studies evaluated TIO/OLO (2.5/5 or 5/5 \u03bcg), eight studies evaluated UMEC/VI (62.5/5, 125/25 or 500/25 \u03bcg) and one study evaluated ACD/FOR (200/6, 200/12 or 200/18 \u03bcg); all LABA/LAMA combinations were compared with placebo.  The risk of bias was generally considered to be low or unknown (insufficient detail provided), with only one study per domain considered to have a high risk of bias except for the domain 'other bias' which was determined to be at high risk of bias in four studies (in three studies, disease severity was greater at baseline in participants receiving LABA/LAMA compared with participants receiving placebo, which would be expected to shift the treatment effect in favour of placebo).  Compared to the placebo, the pooled results for the primary outcomes for the once\u2010daily LABA/LAMA arm were as follows: all\u2010cause mortality, OR 1.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 4.36, low\u2010certainty evidence); all\u2010cause serious adverse events (SAEs), OR 1.06 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.28, high\u2010certainty evidence); acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), OR 0.53 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.78, moderate\u2010certainty evidence); adjusted St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score, MD \u20104.08 (95% CI \u20104.80 to \u20103.36, high\u2010certainty evidence); proportion of SGRQ responders, OR 1.75 (95% CI 1.54 to 1.99). Compared with placebo, the pooled results for the secondary outcomes for the once\u2010daily LABA/LAMA arm were as follows: adjusted trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), MD 0.20 L (95% CI 0.19 to 0.21, moderate\u2010certainty evidence); adjusted peak FEV1, MD 0.31 L (95% CI 0.29 to 0.32, moderate\u2010certainty evidence); and all\u2010cause AEs, OR 0.95 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.04; high\u2010certainty evidence). No studies reported data for the 6\u2010minute walk test. The results were generally consistent across subgroups for different LABA/LAMA combinations and doses.    Authors' conclusions Compared with placebo, once\u2010daily LABA/LAMA (either IND/GLY, UMEC/VI or TIO/OLO) via a combination inhaler is associated with a clinically significant improvement in lung function and health\u2010related quality of life in patients with mild\u2010to\u2010moderate COPD; UMEC/VI appears to reduce the rate of exacerbations in this population. These conclusions are supported by moderate or high certainty evidence based on studies with an observation period of up to one year.",

We included studies that allowed participants to continue using their ICS during the trial as long as the ICS was not part of the randomised treatment; if ICS was administered in combination with LABA prior to the trial, participants should be transitioned to the equivalent ICS monotherapy prior to study start. The effect of continued ICS use was planned to be examined by subgroup analysis (see Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity).",

Respiratory Health\u2010related Quality of Life (HRQoL), as measured by the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ). SAEs can include death, life\u2010threatening adverse reaction, hospitalisation or increased length of hospital stay, disability, and birth defects. We recorded each study's definition of an SAE if it varied from our definition. CRQ and SGRQ are widely\u2010used, reliable and valid measures of patient\u2010reported health status in COPD (Guyatt 1987; Jones 1992). SGRQ scores three domains of health status (symptoms, patient activity, and disease impact), and reports scores ranging from zero (best) to 100 (worst). The Minimally Clinical Important Difference (MCID) is approximately four (Schunemann 2003). That is, a clinically meaningful change in health status is equal to a change of about four points on SGRQ. CRQ scores four domains (shortness of breath, fatigue, emotional function, and mastery), reports scores ranging from one (worst) to seven (best), and has an MCID of 0.5 (Schunemann 2005). While CRQ and SGRQ provide very similar information and are highly correlated, SGRQ is less responsive; it was shown to underestimate treatment effects when compared to CRQ in identical populations (Puhan 2006). Thus, pooling SGRQ data with CRQ data may spuriously suggest heterogeneity of treatment effect. Therefore, SGRQ and CRQ were considered as separate outcomes; this approach agrees with the recommendations of Puhan 2006, who suggest that mean differences for SGRQ and CRQ should be reported separately. We included AECOPD as a main outcome because exacerbations are consistently linked to mortality, morbidity, and costly hospitalisations. Since a consensus definition and standard reporting criteria do not exist for AECOPD (Cazzola 2008), we performed a meta\u2010analysis of AECOPD data only when study authors used one of the following definitions: increase in symptoms precipitating the use of antibiotics; increase in symptoms precipitating the use of systemic steroids; increase in symptoms precipitating emergency room visit; or hospitalisation. The MCID for AECOPD outcomes is not established: Calverley 2005 estimated an MCID of 20% to 25% using a crude anchor\u2010based approach, while Chapman 2013 used an expert consensus process to estimate an MCID of 11%.

Trough (pre\u2010dose) Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1). Peak (post\u2010dose) FEV1. Six\u2010minute walking test (6MWT). Adverse effects. FEV1 is the volume of air forcibly exhaled one second after maximum inhalation. FEV1 is often used for staging COPD (GOLD 2017): FEV1 is 20% lower than normal for patients with mild COPD and 70% lower than normal for patients with very severe COPD. FEV1 is also used to assess treatment effect. However, the MCID for FEV1 has not been quantitatively established (expert opinion proposes an MCID of 100 mL to 140 mL) (Cazzola 2008). Moreover, FEV1 is an intermediate endpoint, representing airflow as a surrogate for clinically important outcomes. Surrogate outcomes are not patient\u2010centred. Nevertheless, we included trough FEV1 because one meta\u2010analysis points to a modest correlation between increased trough FEV1 and improved SGRQ (Westwood 2011). For the purpose of this review we will consider the MCID for FEV1 to be 100 mL (Donohue 2005). In the ECLIPSE study (a non\u2010interventional cohort study of treated COPD patients), one\u2010year change in 6MWT predicted death in the subsequent 12 months. The mean between\u2010group change between survivors and non\u2010survivors was 30 metres (95% CI 26 to 34). Using these results, Polkey 2013 proposed an MCID of about 30 metres. We analysed all\u2010cause adverse effects and serious adverse events reported in studies of LABA or LAMA.",
