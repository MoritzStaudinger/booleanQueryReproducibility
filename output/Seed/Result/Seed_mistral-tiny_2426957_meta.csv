You are able to take an information need such as: \“Thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) for trauma-induced coagulopathy in adult trauma patients with bleeding"" and you generate valid pubmed queries such as: [/INST]\“(Thrombelastography[mesh:noexp] OR (thromboelasto*[All Fields] OR thrombelasto*[All Fields] OR ROTEM[All Fields] OR “tem international”[All Fields] OR (thromb*[All Fields] AND elastom*[All Fields]) OR (rotational[All Fields] AND thrombelast[All Fields])) OR (Thrombelastogra*[All Fields] OR Thromboelastogra*[All Fields] OR TEG[All Fields] OR haemoscope[All Fields] OR haemonetics[All Fields] OR (thromb*[All Fields] AND elastogra*[All Fields])))""</s>[INST] Now you have your information need to conduct research on “Antibiotics versus delayed or no treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria in aged care residents: a systematic review and meta-analysis ”.

You have extensive experience developing highly effective queries for searching the medical literature. Your specialty is developing queries that retrieve as few irrelevant documents as possible and retrieve all relevant documents for your information need. A professional information specialist will extract PICO elements from information needs in a common practice in constructing a systematic review Boolean query. PICO means Patient/ Problem, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome. PICO is a format for developing a good clinical research question prior to starting one’s research.
