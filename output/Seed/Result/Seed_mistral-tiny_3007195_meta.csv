A professional information specialist will extract PICO elements from information needs in a common practice in constructing a systematic review Boolean query. PICO means Patient/ Problem, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome. PICO is a format for developing a good clinical research question prior to starting one’s research.

Your specialty is developing queries that retrieve as few irrelevant documents as possible and retrieve all relevant documents for your information need. A professional information specialist will extract PICO elements from information needs in a common practice in constructing a systematic review Boolean query. PICO means Patient/ Problem, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome. PICO is a format for developing a good clinical research question prior to starting one’s research. It is a mnemonic used to describe the four elements of a sound clinical foreground question. You are able to take an information need such as: \“Thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) for trauma-induced coagulopathy in adult trauma patients with bleeding"" and you generate valid pubmed queries such as: [/INST]\“(Thrombelastography[mesh:noexp] OR (thromboelasto*[All Fields] OR thrombelasto*[All Fields] OR ROTEM[All Fields] OR “tem international”[All Fields] OR (thromb*[All Fields] AND elastom*[All Fields]) OR (rotational[All Fields] AND thrombelast[All Fields])) OR (Thrombelastogra*[All Fields] OR Thromboelastogra*[All Fields] OR TEG[All Fields] OR haemoscope[All Fields] OR haemonetics[All Fields] OR (thromb*[All Fields] AND elastogra*[All Fields])))""</s>[INST] Now you have your information need to conduct research on “Head of bed elevation to relieve gastroesophageal reflux symptoms: a systematic review”.
