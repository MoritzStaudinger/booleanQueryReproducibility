PICO means Patient/ Problem, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome. PICO is a format for developing a good clinical research question prior to starting one’s research. It is a mnemonic used to describe the four elements of a sound clinical foreground question. You are able to take an information need such as: \\“Thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) for trauma-induced coagulopathy in adult trauma patients with bleeding"" and you generate valid pubmed queries such as: \\“(Thrombelastography[mesh:noexp] OR (thromboelasto*[All Fields] OR thrombelasto*[All Fields] OR ROTEM[All Fields] OR “tem international”[All Fields] OR (thromb*[All Fields] AND elastom*[All Fields]) OR (rotational[All Fields] AND thrombelast[All Fields])) OR (Thrombelastogra*[All Fields] OR Thromboelastogra*[All Fields] OR TEG[All Fields] OR haemoscope[All Fields] OR haemonetics[All Fields] OR (thromb*[All Fields] AND elastogra*[All Fields])))"".', ' Now you have your information need to conduct research on “Comparing the quantity and quality of randomised placebo-controlled trials of antibiotics for acute respiratory, urinary, and skin and soft tissue infections: a scoping review”. First, extract PICO elements from the information needs and construct a highly effective systematic review Boolean query that can best serve your information need. Structure the output as a JSON with the field boolean_query and create the boolean query without filtering based on the year.']",(('acute respiratory infections' OR 'pneumonia' OR 'bronchitis' OR 'sinusitis' OR 'pharyngitis' OR 'otitis media' OR 'respiratory tract infections') OR ('urinary tract infections' OR 'cystitis' OR 'pyelonephritis' OR 'UTI') OR ('skin and soft tissue infections' OR 'cellulitis' OR 'abscess' OR 'wound infection' OR 'surgical site infection' OR 'SSTI')) AND ('antibiotics' OR 'antimicrobial agents') AND 'randomized controlled trial' AND 'placebo' NOT (Review[ptyp] OR Comment[ptyp] OR Editorial[ptyp] OR Case Reports[ptyp] OR 'in vitro' OR 'animal studies'),"(""randomised controlled trials"" OR ""randomized controlled trials"" OR RCTs OR ""controlled clinical trials"" OR ""placebo-controlled trials"") AND (antibiotics OR antimicrobials OR antibacterial) AND (""acute respiratory infections"" OR ""respiratory tract infections"" OR pneumonia OR bronchitis OR pharyngitis OR sinusitis OR laryngitis OR ""acute urinary infections"" OR cystitis OR pyelonephritis OR urethritis OR prostatitis OR ""acute skin and soft tissue infections"" OR cellulitis OR abscess OR impetigo OR erysipelas) AND (""trial quality"" OR ""study quality"" OR outcomes OR efficacy OR safety OR ""adverse effects"" OR ""adverse events"")",(('antibiotics' [MeSH Terms] OR 'antibacterial agents' [MeSH Terms] OR 'antimicrobial agents' [All Fields]) AND ('acute respiratory infections' [MeSH Terms] OR 'upper respiratory tract infections' [All Fields] OR 'lower respiratory tract infections' [All Fields] OR 'urinary tract infections' [MeSH Terms] OR 'cystitis' [All Fields] OR 'pyelonephritis' [All Fields] OR 'skin and soft tissue infections' [All Fields] OR 'cellulitis' [All Fields] OR 'abscess' [All Fields])) AND ('randomized controlled trial' [Publication Type] OR 'randomized' [Title/Abstract] OR 'placebo' [Title/Abstract]) AND ('comparative study' [Publication Type] OR 'comparison*' [Title/Abstract]),"((antibiotics[mesh] OR antibacterial agents[mesh] OR anti-bacterial agents[mesh] OR antiinfective agents[mesh] OR anti-infective agents[mesh] OR antimicrobial[mesh:noexp] OR antibacterials[mesh] OR ""antibiotics""[All Fields] OR ""antibacterial agents""[All Fields] OR ""antimicrobial agents""[All Fields] OR ""anti-infective agents""[All Fields] OR antimicrob*[All Fields] OR antibacter*[All Fields] OR antibiotic*[All Fields])) AND (""randomized controlled trial""[Publication Type] OR ""randomized controlled trials as topic""[mesh] OR random*[All Fields] AND (trial[All Fields] OR trials[All Fields])) AND (placebo[All Fields] OR placebos[All Fields] OR ""placebo effect""[mesh] OR placebo*[All Fields]) AND ((""respiratory tract infections""[mesh:noexp] OR respiratory[All Fields] AND (tract[All Fields] AND infection*[All Fields]) OR respiratory infection*[All Fields] OR ""acute respiratory infection""[All Fields] OR URI[All Fields] OR upper respiratory infection*[All Fields] OR LRI[All Fields] OR lower respiratory infection*[All Fields] OR acute bronchitis[All Fields] OR pneumonia[All Fields] OR pharyngitis[All Fields] OR sinusitis[All Fields] OR otitis media[All Fields] OR common cold[All Fields]) OR (""urinary tract infections""[mesh:noexp] OR urinary[All Fields] AND (tract[All Fields] AND infection*[All Fields]) OR urinary infection*[All Fields] OR cystitis[All Fields] OR pyelonephritis[All Fields]) OR (""soft tissue infections""[mesh:noexp] OR skin infection*[All Fields] OR cellulitis[All Fields] OR abscess[All Fields] OR wound infection*[All Fields] OR cutaneous infection*[All Fields] OR SSTI[All Fields] OR ""skin and soft tissue infection""[All Fields]))","(""Randomized Controlled Trial""[Publication Type] OR Randomized[Title/Abstract] OR Randomised[Title/Abstract] OR ""Controlled Clinical Trial""[Publication Type] OR placebo[Title/Abstract] OR ""Clinical Trials as Topic""[Mesh] OR ""Random Allocation""[Mesh] OR ""Double-Blind Method""[Mesh] OR ""Single-Blind Method""[Mesh]) AND (Antibiotics[Title/Abstract] OR Anti-Bacterial Agents[Mesh] OR Antimicrobial[Title/Abstract] OR Antibacterial[Title/Abstract]) AND (""Respiratory Tract Infections""[Mesh] OR ""Respiratory System""[Mesh] AND infection[Title/Abstract] OR Pneumonia[Mesh] OR Bronchitis[Mesh] OR Pharyngitis[Mesh] OR Sinusitis[Mesh] OR ""Urinary Tract Infections""[Mesh] OR Pyelonephritis[Mesh] OR Cystitis[Mesh] OR Urethritis[Mesh] OR ""Skin Diseases, Infectious""[Mesh] OR ""Soft Tissue Infections""[Mesh] OR Cellulitis[Mesh] OR Abscess[Mesh] OR Wound Infection[Title/Abstract]) AND (Comparative Study[Publication Type] OR comparison[Title/Abstract] OR compare[Title/Abstract] OR compared[Title/Abstract] OR comparing[Title/Abstract]) NOT (animals[mesh] NOT humans[mesh])"
