1. Start by identifying the main concepts in the information need: ""surgeon's effect,"" ""patients' physical health,"" and ""further investigation.""

2. Break down each concept into keywords or key phrases that best represent them. For example:

   a. Surgeon's effect: surgeon OR surgical OR surgical team OR operative team
   b. Patients' physical health: physical health OR physical well-being OR patient outcomes OR surgical outcomes
   c. Further investigation: research OR study OR examination OR investigation OR systematic review

3. Combine the keywords or key phrases using Boolean operators (AND, OR) to construct the query. Here's an example query:

   (surgeon OR surgical OR surgical team OR operative team) AND (physical health OR physical well-being OR patient outcomes OR surgical outcomes) AND (research OR study OR examination OR investigation OR systematic review)

4. Utilize truncation (*) or wildcards (?, $) to account for variations in word endings or spellings where applicable.

   (surgeon* OR surgical* OR surgical team* OR operative team*) AND (physical health* OR physical well-being* OR patient outcomes* OR surgical outcomes*) AND (research OR study OR examination OR investigation OR systematic review)

This query includes relevant keywords related to parasympathomimetics, underactive bladder, and systematic review/meta-analysis in order to retrieve the most relevant studies for your review.","To develop a highly effective Boolean query for your research topic on the effectiveness of parasympathomimetics for treating underactive bladder, you can use the following search strategy:

(PICO elements)

P: Patients with underactive bladder
I: Intervention with parasympathomimetics
C: Comparison group (if applicable)
O: Outcome measures for effectiveness

Boolean operators and truncation symbols used in the query:

- AND: Used to combine different search concepts together
- OR: Used to combine similar concepts or synonyms
- NOT: Used to exclude certain terms or concepts from the search results
- *: Used for truncation and to retrieve different word endings or variations

Based on the above, a highly effective Boolean query for your research topic could be:

((underactive bladder OR detrusor underactivity) AND (parasympathomimetics OR cholinergic agonists OR muscarinic agonists)) AND (systematic review OR meta-analysis OR evaluation OR efficacy OR effectiveness OR outcomes)

By using this query, you will be able to retrieve relevant articles that focus on the effectiveness of parasympathomimetics for treating underactive bladder and that have been systematically reviewed or evaluated.","To generate a highly effective systematic review Boolean query for the topic ""The effectiveness of parasympathomimetics for treating underactive bladder: A systematic review and meta‐analysis,"" we can use the PICO framework to structure our query. PICO stands for Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome.

Population: Patients with underactive bladder
Intervention: Parasympathomimetics
Comparison: Placebo or alternative interventions for underactive bladder
Outcome: Effectiveness of treatment

Using these elements, we can create a Boolean query for PubMed:

((""underactive bladder"" OR ""bladder underactivity"" OR ""hypotonic bladder"" OR ""neurogenic bladder, flaccid"" OR ""neurogenic bladder, acontractile"") AND (""parasympathomimetics"" OR ""cholinergic agonists"" OR ""muscarinic agonists"" OR ""anticholinesterase agents"" OR ""acetylcholine esterase inhibitors"" OR ""bethanechol"")) AND (""randomized controlled trial""[Publication Type] OR ""systematic review""[Publication Type] OR ""meta-analysis""[Publication Type])

This query would retrieve studies that include relevant terms for underactive bladder and parasympathomimetics. It also limits the results to randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses to focus on high-quality evidence.

Remember to adjust the query based on your specific requirements and other databases you may be searching. It is also recommended to consult a research librarian or information specialist for assistance in constructing the query to ensure comprehensive and accurate results.","(""(Parasympathomimetics[mesh:noexp] OR (parasympathomimetic*[All Fields] OR cholinergic*[All Fields] OR muscarinic*[All Fields])) AND (Underactive Bladder[mesh:noexp] OR (underactive[All Fields] AND bladder[All Fields]) OR (hypotonic[All Fields] AND bladder[All Fields]) OR (neurogenic[All Fields] AND bladder[All Fields]) OR (areflexic[All Fields] AND bladder[All Fields]) OR (weak[All Fields] AND bladder[All Fields]) OR (incomplete[All Fields] AND bladder[All Fields]) OR (lazy[All Fields] AND bladder[All Fields]) OR (flaccid[All Fields] AND bladder[All Fields])))"".","P: Underactive bladder

Let's break down the query and explain the rationale behind each section:

1. ((""Kidney Transplantation""[Mesh]) OR ""Living Donors""[Mesh]) OR ""Tissue and Organ Procurement""[Mesh]
   - This portion of the query focuses on retrieving studies related to kidney transplantation, living donors, and tissue/organ procurement. It includes articles that are indexed under these specific MeSH terms.

2. ((""Altruism""[Mesh]) OR (""Living Donor Transplantation""[Mesh]) OR (""Organ Donation""[Mesh]))
   - This section targets studies related to altruism, living donor transplantation, and organ donation. Again, it includes articles indexed under these specific MeSH terms.

3. ((""Intervention Studies""[Mesh]) OR ""Interventional Studies""[Mesh])
   - This part of the query focuses on retrieving intervention studies. It includes articles that are indexed under MeSH terms related to intervention studies.

4. ((""Humans""[Mesh]) AND (""English""[lang]))
   - This section ensures that only studies involving human participants and written in English are included in the search results. It limits the inclusion of irrelevant non-human or non-English studies.

5. NOT ""Review""[Publication Type] NOT ""Comment""[Publication Type]
   - This part of the query excludes studies categorized as reviews or comments. It helps filter out potentially irrelevant articles that are not primary research studies.

By combining these elements in the query, it aims to retrieve relevant studies on interventions that improve the rate of unspecified altruistic living kidney donations while minimizing the inclusion of irrelevant studies.","""(Intervention*[All Fields] OR treatment*[All Fields] OR strategy[All Fields] OR approach[All Fields] OR program[All Fields] OR technique[All Fields] OR method[All Fields]) AND (improve*[All Fields] OR increase*[All Fields] OR enhance*[All Fields] OR boost*[All Fields] OR promote*[All Fields] OR augment*[All Fields] OR raise*[All Fields]) AND (rate[All Fields] OR frequency[All Fields] OR incidence[All Fields] OR prevalence[All Fields]) AND (unspecified[All Fields] OR unspecified[All Fields]) AND (altruistic[All Fields] OR living[All Fields]) AND (kidney[All Fields] OR renal[All Fields]) AND (donat*[All Fields] OR give[All Fields] OR offer[All Fields] OR contribute[All Fields])""","Patient/Problem: unspecified altruistic living kidney donations

Feel free to modify the terms or add additional search criteria as needed.","To develop a highly effective Boolean query for your systematic review on estimating the extent of asymptomatic COVID-19 and its potential for community transmission, the following approach can be used:

1. Break down the main concepts of your information need: ""asymptomatic COVID-19,"" ""extent,"" ""community transmission.""

2. Identify synonyms and related terms for each concept. Here are some examples:

   - Asymptomatic COVID-19: asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, no symptoms of COVID-19, silent transmission, absence of symptoms, covert infection.
   - Extent: prevalence, occurrence, frequency, magnitude, burden.
   - Community transmission: local transmission, community spread, person-to-person transmission, secondary infections.

3. Combine the synonyms and related terms using Boolean operators (AND, OR) to create a comprehensive query. Here's an example query:

   (""asymptomatic COVID-19"" OR ""asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection"" OR ""no symptoms of COVID-19"" OR ""silent transmission"" OR ""absence of symptoms"" OR ""covert infection"") AND (prevalence OR occurrence OR frequency OR magnitude OR burden) AND (""community transmission"" OR ""local transmission"" OR ""community spread"" OR ""person-to-person transmission"" OR ""secondary infections"")

4. Ensure to include any additional search terms or concepts specific to your research question or interests.

1. ((""Face masks""[MeSH Terms] OR ""face masks""[All Fields] OR ""masks""[All Fields])
This part of the query captures articles that mention face masks using different terminology variations. We include the MeSH term and also search for occurrences of ""face masks"" or ""masks"" in any field of the document.

2. (""adverse effects""[MeSH Terms] OR ""adverse effects""[All Fields] OR ""side effects""[All Fields] OR ""risks""[All Fields])
This part focuses on capturing articles that discuss the downsides of face masks. We search for articles that mention adverse effects, side effects, or risks related to wearing face masks in any field or using the MeSH term.

3. (""mitigation""[All Fields] OR ""strategies""[All Fields] OR ""prevention and control""[Subheading] OR ""control""[All Fields] OR ""prevention""[All Fields])
This last part captures articles that discuss mitigation strategies related to face masks. We search for articles that mention mitigation, strategies, prevention, or control in any field of the document or using the appropriate subheading.
